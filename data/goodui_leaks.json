It's difficult to guess what type of effect this might have had if any. One thought (a big guess) is that perhaps having two logos (Zalando vs. Bugatti) creates some uncertainty about who might fulfill the order.

Although Booking prompts for dates with the calendar picker, they smart default to probably the most common number of guests (ex: 2 adults, and 1 room). They also show this default visibly inside the search component and possibly save some users an extra step.\nSecond, Booking has this search interaction on their more general homepage, whereas Airbnb has tested it on a deeper results / listing page. Could it be that once people start seeing potential results (seen on the Airbnb screenshot), they are more interested in browsing deeper into particular listings, rather than making additional choices?\nDo you have any other thoughts as to why this might be working on Booking, but not for Airbnb?"

The email field appeared after a user moved from the hompage, through a series of confirmation steps, and a plan selection - what might officially be counted as the fifth step.

In the B variation however we can see two instances of the email field being shown beside the signup button as a required field. This version was implemented and so we presume that the effect must have been positive.\nSo does this mean that we should always ask for an email early on? I suspect that the effect of this is also dependent on possibly another variable, such as the quality of the followup emails. If the nurturing emails are doing a good job at warming up undecided users to become customers, then this might be even more effective. \nThe closest and related patterns to this might include:"

The possible advantage of such a change might be a higher contrast / greater visibility of the input. The counter hypothesis might be that the grey fill risks suggesting inactivity.

The visual mentions the 30 days free trial, the date of the reminder email, the first billing and future billing dates. It's an interesting concept but I have no idea whether this is a good or bad thing. This could easily have positive or negative effects and perhaps would be best tested in isolation?",

Again, this type of content looks very similar to the previously failed experiment. These changes (1 and 5) could easily have brought down the full experiment into net negative territory - washing out any positive gains from all other changes.",

These have categorized the movies with such labels as: most popular, action, comedies, drama, etc. Although I believe that this element has the most potential (based on the heavily replicating Gradual Reassurance pattern), one other critical element might have been varied here. The movie thumbnails shown in variations C-E are defaulted to the \"most popular\" titles such as \"Friends\" and \"The Office\". Whereas the thumbnails in the homepage seem like they focus more on novel titles. I wonder if this was a conscious decision or something that might have been overlooked. If this was accidental, then a tighter experiment setup could have shown more of these \"New\" movies titles with greater consistency with the control.",

            "sub": [
                "Why The Experiment Failed\nI suspect that the reason why this Netflix experiment failed is that it contains a mixture of negative and positive changes. The problem isn't that there are too many changes. The problem is that the potentially positive changes might have been overshadowed by the negative ones.\nWe know this because it looks like all variations were rejected on March the 23rd. We also know that similar changes present in this experiment (see 1 and 5) were already tested before with possibly negative effects (was that forgotten?). And we know that some changes are very similar to positive probability patterns (Gradual Reassurance and Product Previews) that have led to winning results for other companies. \nIterating On The Experiment - The Concept\nIf it were up to me to design the next homepage experiment for Netflix, I would recommend to further explore the Movie Preview Thumbnails idea. It's very closely tied to the promising Gradual Reassurance pattern backed by multiple positive experiments. The pattern idea is to let people express a desirable choice, followed by a reassuring statement. Letting people find what they are looking for (before signing up) can be a powerful way of building up motivation and providing a solid reason to move forward.\nIn terms of experimentation strategy, this setup follows a very simple principle: test your highest probability ideas first. The experiment design below shows two variations: B and C with ways of implementing the change. The first variation replaces the existing header, while the second variations adds or appends it as a new content block. Such a high level setup is just a safety check to make sure that nothing critical is lost by replacing and losing something important from the header.\n\n\nThe experiment could also be further extended with additional variations about the types of choices being asked. For example, users could be asked about their preference for: movie categories, audience types, or even keyword input for the concrete shows they might be looking for, etc. Having a number of variations in this case would aim to discover what people wish to express the most when looking to watch shows or movies. \nWould be interesting to see if Netflix picks this up and turns this into an experiment. :)"

By doing this little exercise we can see how the screen has evolved with numerous UI changes - some of which were probably tested while others possibly decided upon. Overall, it looks like the new 2020 layout is a little more condensed (shorter in length), and yet it still managed to increase the size of key information as well as form fields. Here are the 15 changes which I thought were the most interesting ...",

                "Changed Styling Of Slideshow Arrows\nInstead of using semi-transparent rectangular slideshow arrows, they were restylized with drop shadows, rounding, and a full opacity white background. Perhaps such styling brings them out more across a range of dark and light images?",
                "Larger Price\nIn the 2020 version, the price of the product has been made more visible using a larger font and more padding.",
                "Larger Form Fields\n",
                "More Emphasis On Customer Star Ratings And Number Of Reviews\nThe customer reviews along with the review counts have also increased in size.",
                "Distinction Between Shop & Product Reviews\nInterestingly, reviews have been organized into two tabs. One for shop reviews and another set for product reviews (defaulted of course).",
                "Condensed And More Complete Reviews\nThe actual customer reviews have been condensed by removing large inline authentic customer photos. And yet, some truncation has been relaxed by allowing more complete multiple-line reviews to be displayed.",
                "Exposed Pagination\nComparing the old version to the newer 2020 one, we can see that a tiny \"more\" link for customer reviews has been replaced with more exposed pagination - most likely making it clearer that there are more reviews.",
                "Larger Authentic Customer Photos\nThe size of the customer submitted photos has been increased, decreasing their maximum display from 5 photos to 4.",
                "Larger Availability Information\nInformation about when an item can be shipped and when it can arrive has been drastically increased in size.",
                "Simpler Returns Information\nIn the older version, a full section about detailed returns has been displayed. In the newer version, all of this has been simplified into a few lines of text - with the ability to see detailed store policies.",

Two potentially leading variations (C & G) were then retested in a followup A/B test.

Overall, given the amount of evidence from past experiments, I'm not surprised that the smallest and icon-only version didn't make it.",

                "Add To My Cart\nThe G variation is comparable to C, in that it has the extra word \"my\" in \"Add to my cart\". This makes the label wider (which based on past patterns should contribute to a better result). However, when C and G were tested in a follow up experiment, compared to C, the increase size of the G button and the additional \"my\" did not deliver enough signal to outperform C.",
                "Yes, I Want This\nThis button label starts with a strong affirmative \"Yes\". This version did not manage to deliver the best result and was also rejected. The most comparable experiment to this variation is this test with a similar label change (but soon we'll turn this into a separate pattern as we have more expeirments like this in the pipeline).

In fact, all variations in Bol's experiment introduced two variables: label changes AND button size changes. So unfortunately, if we truly wish to infer anything about button labels or button sizes, we have a classic case of confounding here. Assuming we wanted to learn about these variables, a slightly better setup would have been to isolate one change per variant (ex: with a fixed button width).\nGrouping multiple changes together is still a good strategy when you already have past data and are designing a bigger experiment to maximize gains."

Instead of placing the icon directly over property thumbnails (as in the control), it was A/B tested with a rightmost position of a wide listing - and eventually implemented. This might be a tiny change, but a few possible explanations came to mind as to why this turned out the way it did. \n(We also have other effective patterns that have been tested on listing & search results screens.)",

If so, here is one hypothetical explanation:\nPossible Explanation: More Central Position. Perhaps a more central position of the icon made it easier to interact with and save more listings. If we assume that while users scroll down a page their cursors are somewhere in the center or right of the screen (ex: near the scroll bar), having a functional save icon closer to the cursor might bridge the spacial gap - and require less time according to Fitt's Law. In other words - having functions on the very left of the screen could make them more distant and harder to interact with (would be great for someone to double check this).",
                "Unobstructed Thumbnails\nAs the icon shifted to the right, the thumbnail image became more visible and less obstructed. Could this have had some positive effects?\nPossible Explanation: More Visible Thumbnails. Perhaps this simply means that more visible property images without any overlapping elements provide users with a better preview image that helps with their decision making. Although the overlapping icon was tiny, perhaps in some edge cases it hid some key visuals and lead to an inferior experience.\nPossible Explanation: Fewer Errors. We might also notice that both the save icon and the thumbnail photo have unique functions assigned to them. The icon saves a listing, whereas the thumbnail leads to a property detail page. Perhaps when these two were being overlapped, it lead to more accidental clicks and unintentional results (ex: users trying to save but accidentally clicking on the thumbnail and going into the property itself, or vice versa)."

                "Shifted Title\nIt looks like the property title was shifted above the photo in the B variation. The titles might also have become slightly smaller and the review metadata has also been positioned closer underneath. Are these changes any better or worse? I honestly don't know.",
                "Smaller And More Padded Photos\nMoving on, we can also see that the layout was narrowed forcing the photos to become narrower, while also gaining additional padding. I also don't know if this is better or worse and I wish Airbnb could test this in isolation so that we could find out. :) (Reminder: sometime in the past we obtained one little hint of evidence that too tall photos might be somewhat inferior but that could be slightly different).",
                "Less Visible Buttons - Possibly Worse\nThe control version used secondary buttons for things like: Share, Save and View Photos. The first two actions were turned into links - possibly less visible. Whereas the third action (View Photos) also lost some visibility by being repositioned onto a white surface (away from a higher contrast background photo).",
                "Singled Out Host Picture\nIn the variation we see a host profile picture that has lost its label. :) It's right aligned and looks singled out. If I had to guess, I would make a tiny bet that this is slightly inferior.",
                "Lots Of Primary Panel Changes - Very Likely Worse\nHere we can start seeing multiple changes to the primary checkout panel.\nFirst of all notice how the customer rating summaries that were shifted into the header seem to have lost their prominence. Combined with the fact that the control's panel is floating (for the most of the page height), the reviews and ratings have more visibility in A which we know is probably a good thing.\nSecondly, the A version has a call to action that is proceeded with other choices that guests might wish to express: dates and guests. The B variation on the other hand removed this choice - and this could be one of those situations where gradual choice is actually beneficial.\nMore so, the messaging \"You won't be charged today\" looks like it disappeared. And yet, we also know that such forms of pay later messages are usually positive on conversions and sales.\nOh, and the button label in B also was changed to a less committal one - \"Check Availability\". Of course by losing the \"Reserve\" copy, perhaps some element of urgency or scarcity was also lost in the process. Here I'm not sure which one is better or worse.",
                "Bigger Icons\nIn variation B we can see some stylistic adjustments of using slightly larger icons.",
                "New Translate Feature\nThe B variation also looks like it has a new (or at least more visible) translation feature. I'm not sure if this better or worse.",
                "Towards Black Links And Ghost Buttons - Mostly Likely Worse\nSomehow, someone thought that removing color from secondary links and buttons and making them the same black as standard text was better. We're somewhat asking ourselves the same question under the contrast pattern and although we're getting mixed results, I doubt that this was a wise move. Clickable items should stand out and color is an additional cue that can be used to trigger action.\nSecondly, you might also notice that some secondary links were replaced with ghost buttons. Although we have stacking evidence against ghost buttons (compared to full colored ones), I'm not sure that in this case they are any worse compared to the smaller links. It would be interesting to see how ghost buttons compare to simple links - perhaps we could make a bet that due to the increased size, they might actually perform better?",
                "Larger Section Subtitles\nThe font size of sections such as \"Sleeping arrangements\" and \"Amenities\" was increased slightly - possibly better or not? Subjectively this feels like a good move.",
                "More Amenities\nMore amenity properties have been displayed for better or for worse. :)",
                "Stretched Layout\nStarting at the reviews section, we can see a full width layout appearing. Subjectively, I feel that the labels and their corresponding line bars are too far apart. For example: the \"Stylish space\" has a corresponding count of 58 and this number is actually closer to the next \"Amazing amenities\" label - potentially misleading with a false association.",
                "Fewer Testimonials & Reviews - Possibly Worse\nWith the shift towards a two column layout, 7 visible reviews were truncated into 4, while also having removed guests' replies. Given that showing more reviews might be actually better, I'm going to bet that this might have been a negative change.",
                "From Reviews Pagination To Show All\nFurthermore, we see that the pagination feature for all reviews was replaced with a \"Show all 489 reviews\" button. This raises more question - are people less inclined to look at such a huge number of results instead of using the pagination with a smaller subset of reviews? Not sure - just a hypothesis.",
                "Wider Map\nClearly the map in the B variation is wider with a stronger location indicator in the center. I can't see how this change could have had a negative effect.",
                "Oh ... The Fragmented Calendar\nThe calendar starts fragmented: it's asking for the same thing (check-in date) twice by showing both an input field and a calendar. This doesn't feel right at all.\nMore so, the original calendar made use of stronger visual cues for unavailable (disabled grey) and available dates (green). The B variation however dulled both styles closer together - removing important cues. I know that the A variation is actually better because Airbnb ran this calendar style change seaprately in isolation and we'll be covering this in a separate article.",
                "More \"More Places To Stay\" - Most Likely Better\nNotice how the total number of \"places to stay\" was increase to 4 from 3. From other experiments we can detect signal that this might be a good move.",
                "More Padding In Footer\nThe B variation also increased the padding of all link items in the footer - probably a good thing I'd guess."

                "How To Do Big Leap Experiments?\nIf the outcome of this experiment in fact was negative, I can't help to notice that there is a common mistake in how these bigger experiments are designed in the first place. The mistake is not of having too many changes. Instead, it's about having too many changes with mixed probabilities (better and worse changes combined together) that are cancelling each other out. We have observed Amazon and Netflix also make this mistake.\n\nInstead of mixing both negative and positive changes, I would advise to separate the probable positive patterns from the probable negative ones, or unknowns. When an experiment is designed to only contain highly probable positive changes, its likelihood to detect a big improvement, increases. So I do believe there is more upside to some of the ideas tried above.\nWatch: How To Run Bigger Experiments if you're interested more about the topic."

Unfortunately, as of this month it seems that the experiment has stopped with no sight of the variation - hinting at a rejection for whatever reason. In retrospect, I do have some ideas along with my personal and mixed bets on these UI changes. All in all, I suspect a possible confounding situation with some negative changes cancelling out the positive. Perhaps one day Walmart re-runs some of these positive-only bets in a future iteration?",

If it were up to me I'd mark this as a big unknown probably worthy of isolation in a separate single change experiment.\n(One could argue even to give this change a negative bet on the grounds of icons with labels having some positive signal.)",
                "Prominent: How Would You Like Your Items - My Bet: NEGATIVE\nThe second visible change in the variation is the emphasis given to the \"how would you like your item\" component. This component had a fly out that provided users with the option to adjust whether they would like their items: shipped, delivered or pickup themselves.\nThere are two possible problems with this componment and the extra emphasis it gained: 1) The difference between shipping and delivery might be ambigous and confusing. 2) In my case the auto detected location of Sacramento, US (instead of Toronto, Canada) is thousands of kilometers off. Perhaps giving this additional attention in its current implementation isn't helping. And so this change gets a negative bet from me.",

                "Changed Position And Label Of \"Reorder My Items\" - My Bet: UNKNOWN\nIn the variation we can see that \"Reorder My Items\" moved from the top right towards the second navigation level as \"My Items\". I think \"reorder\" is a bit more powerful along with the top right position (perhaps somewhat similar to Amazon?). I'll tag this as an unknown bet (as I'm refraining myself from a negative one).",
                "Larger Font Size For Category Links - My Bet: POSITIVE\nWe can see that the variation increased the font size of the listed categories which may be a good thing. In past experiments I've seen additional search triggers increase various effects - and so this gets my positive bet.",
                "Navigation Color Change - My Bet: UNKNOWN\nWe can also see a shift from a darker blue background to a lighter one (barely different from a white background). Something tells me that the darker blue color with white text links is more visible than the inverse. But I'll tag this as an unknown.",

The control's exposed filters on the left column were collapsed in two variations and made visible with the use of an overlay. One variation collapsed the filters completely while another added an extra layer of horizontal categories.\nI typically see exposing options leading to positive effects while this experiment seems to have challenged this. If the outcome of this experiment has been captured correctly, then it seems that Etsy might have found an interesting exception to this pattern.

It gained a border (as it was turned into a ghost button), as well as, was shifter higher. I would easily expect more interactions with sorting from these changes.\nAs a followup experiment, I'm wondering if the sorting would be more effective exposed as in Bol's experiment.",

            "main": "I believe Airbnb just a/b tested infinite scrolling and rolled it out. Sometime this year they evolved their homepage to include specific property listings. As  these property tiles appeared, a month ago I also managed to capture a screenshot of two versions of their homepage: one with 40 results per page that would load more listings with a \"Show More\" button; and another version with an endless or infinite scroll. \nThis blew my socks off as Etsy's Dan McKinley tried a similar experiment 10 years ago that was rejected. Apparently there were -50% items being viewed and almost -23% fewer sales.",

                "So Does This Mean Infinite Scrolling Is Now Better?\nI don't know. I would like to see more experiments with actual data before committing to any confidence one way or the other. Both of these experiments are only very high level signals. There has been some analysis on the topic here and lots of discussion over at Hacker News some years ago.\nIn the presentation, Dan also admits that they did not iterate on the idea of infinite scrolling as they did on other more successful experiments. This leads me to believe that alternative and effective versions of infinite scrolling may exist.\nPerhaps the effectiveness of infinite scrolling may be conditional. Perhaps it interacts with other elements or UI behaviors. Although I haven't seen how Etsy did their implementation back in 2012, we can perhaps infer a number of things about the current and successful 2022 Airbnb implementation. For example we know that: \n\nAirbnb opens listing tiles in new tabs. Perhaps this makes it easier to search for listings in one tab, while looking at item (property) details in another one, while switching between both of these modes. Whereas, perhaps in Etsy's case back in 2012, hitting the back button reset the position of the search? \n\nAirbnb floats the search box. Perhaps the visibility of the search (and category links) is critical as a quick way out in order to continue refining the results. I'm not sure how Etsy did this in 2012.\n\nBrowser Compatibility Issues. A lot of things have changed and improved in the last 10 years when it comes to browsers and asynchronous interactions. On Hacker News, the Etsy developers themselves commented that there were issues with Internet Explorer. \n\nInline Favoriting. Airbnb in 2022 has inline listing favoriting - if that matters."

Included below is a wider breakdown of the key changes I noticed in this larger experiment.\nThat's not too say that all modal interaction have negative results.

In contrast, the B variation uses a numerical representation to show the averages with one or two decimal places - and this version has been rolled out.\nWhy might decimal places be better? One simplest explanation I could think of as to why actual numbers might be better is that they make it easier to compare reviews that have similar ratings (especially when those averages are similar to each other - ex: 4.62 and 4.87).\nThe second potential reason is that high ratings look too perfect. Just looking at the screenshot above, for example, the A version shows what appears like a perfect 5/5 stars, whereas it's a 4.92 average rating.

Although we've detected this variation being tested on many product pages (such as kitchen appliances) Bol continues to display products without these product quantities. Some of these might include: highly priced items, wines, or products already sold as sets. There might be other cases out there where this pattern breaks down as well.

They just completed a creative homepage experiment where they tested multiple variations with multiple changes of which I will show a selected few for simplification. It also seems like what most resembles variation D was eventually rolled out - suggesting it performed the best. Please also do take note that there might also been an additional photo background change after the experiment ended.

                "Smaller Search Box\nOne of the first changes visible in variation D is a smaller or narrower search box. I find this a little surprising as typically larger form fields have done a little better as hinted by this pattern. For example, Etsy recently detected that a larger search box worked better for them. Netflix on the other hand hit an optimal limit to the size of their signup buttons. It would have been super interesting to run this change in isolation and see the results.",
                "Smaller Icon Only Search Button\nEqually surprising is the smaller icon only search button. Typically such buttons have been outperformed by buttons with icons and labels. Could the search icon be powerful enough to be an exception? Or does a button label still have higher potential if ran in an isolated experiment?\nOne additional observation is that the icon only button expands to reveal a full text label after someone enters or focuses on the location field. This could be an interesting way of directing attention first to the field itself and later to the button.",
                "Input Field With Background Contrast\nAs the background photo was stretched in variation D, as an added effect it also made the white search box stand out more. I suspect this change might have had some subtle gains to the number of people who started searching for properties (probably a good micro engagement metric).",
                "Local Messaging\nThe headline message was adjusted, reinforcing local or nearby searches. Could this be a message that is more inline with how some might feel these days based on what is happening with the pandemic?",

This pattern has a few positive experiments to back it up under the Full Height False Bottom pattern. Let's do keep in mind that when Airbnb ran something similar on one of their other landing pages, it seems to have been rejected."

                "More Visible Button\nHere we can see a number of differences that I believe compound to a more visible and inviting call to action (in variation B). First of all, the control  version uses the same black styling for both the headline and the button - potentially diluting the button's clickable trigger. Whereas the white background button in the winning variation is a lot more comparable to the search box at the top of the page. I think this consistent styling, right upfront conveys that there are two equal weighed choices in how customers can search.\nFurthermore, the button in the B variation is also: larger, more central, has more padding, and has larger text.\nI would predict that all these factors taken together have encouraged customers to click on the \"I'm flexible\" button a lot more.",

Other than that, I'm not going to guess if these played much of a role in the outcome.",
                "More Category Choices As Tabs\nAfter clicking on the buttons, customers would move to the next listing screen with a series of thumbnail results. Again, a little warning here that I'm not sure whether these were two separate experiments (on two separate screens) or one bigger one (wrapping both the homepage and the listing page). Either way, the first change that is interesting is the ability to switch between property categories in a tabbed interaction. Variation B shows such high level categories as: tree houses, boats, tiny homes, etc. and I'm confident this is an improvement based on this pattern.",
                "Larger Home Thumbnails\nLooking at the listing thumbnails in variation B, we can see that they are both larger and better capture the home from the outside along with its environment. I don't have any data on this particular change but this seems like it might be a really interesting change to be tested in isolation.",
                "Clearer Property Location And Proximity\nLet's remember that most customers here probably haven't yet entered a date nor location. Variation B does a better job at highlighting the location by: bolding, placing it as the first data type, as well as including both city and state. More so, notice how a simple \"X km away\" data reinforces the same message of proximity. These changes feel like a great way to let customers understand how far or close a listing is away from them. Love it.",
                "Ability To Switch To Map View\nFinally, at the bottom of the listing screen in variation B, we can see a simple floating toggle that allows customers to swtich to a map view. Very interesting! :)"

Google may have only run this experiment on a very defined segment of some sort - possibly only effective in certain situations.

The videos made it super clear that the hosts set the house rules, and can choose when to make their listing available for rent.\nOne thing which I though was a little surprising however was that each video showed various people even though the default video image would only show a single one. Sometimes the people in the snapshot and the video weren't the first ones to be shown when played. Could this subtle inconsistency of actors have anything to do with the test outcome? Not sure.\nOr perhaps it's simply more effective to show a summary of reassurances (like the \"We've got you covered\" section) rather than raising a single question at a time. Perhaps bulleted summaries are quicker to scan and quicker to find the relevant answers than having to watch a 40 second video?\nThese of course are just retrospective guesses.

            "main": "Netflix ran an experiment with two variations of appended secondary links underneath the main \"Try It Now\" button. One variation had a link urging users to sign-in, while another urged to resume signing-up. Both ideas didn't make it and have been rejected. Here are my thoughts and comparisons on this ...",
            "ui_change": [
                "Added Secondary Sign-In Link\nIn the B variation we can see that a text with a link \"Have an account? Sign In\" has been added as an alternative call to action. And yet this variation did not outperform the control version without the added link. I find this little piece of evidence interesting as it's a subtle challenge to the Hobson’s+1 Choice Effect - Bart Schutz's general idea of having more than one call to action. It looks like having a single call to action in this case worked out better. Could it be that the alternative sign in link distracted people from signing up and lead to an increase in additional errors?\nA possibly better way to do sign-in\nIf the above explanation holds, then it might be inline with a pattern about combining sign-in and signup (from a well respected experimenter - Ethan Smith). The idea is to merge signing in and signing up by combining enough smarts to detect whether it's a return signin or first time signup. Although we still don't have any real data for or against this pattern.\nSo does this mean that all secondary choices won't work?\nNot at all. We actually do have some accumulating evidence in favor of showing alternative links that educate users about a product or service (think \"Learn More\" links and such). The idea is to offer secondary links to pages with more information (and repated calls to action) that help them choose whether the product or service is for them or not.",
                "Added A Fake Restart Membership Link\nIn the C variant we can see a secondary message with the text and link \"Been a member before? Restart membership\". This also didn't outperform the control variation. Could this simply be because this secondary link was actually artificial? There was no logic or personalization which goverened it being displayed. It was simply a shot in the dark with the hope of perhaps connecting with users who might or might not have been members in the past. Well, this didn't work.\nAnd yet personalized messaging for return visitors does show promse\nWhen we look at example of screens that have been adjusted for return users based on \"real unfinished tasks\", we see positive evidence in favor of such patterns as cart reminders and personalized buttons. Return visit personalization can work. it just needs to be based on real user actions and not artificial guesses."
            ],
            "sub": [
                "The Right Way To Personalize For Return Visitors\nHere is another screenshot of what the Netflix homepage looks like when a user does not completely finish their signup process and moves past the email step. Notice how the homepage welcomes them back and the call to action evolves to a \"finish sign up\" message. More so, this button now links further into the signup funnel where they might have left of. This example is the right way to go about this and inline with some of the personalization evidence we have already collected."

The \"Add to Cart\" would appear first and move customers into a confirming shopping cart screen with potential upsells. While the \"Buy Now\" button below would skip the shopping cart and try to send customers one step ahead into a shipping address selection page - essentially a very subtle shortcut. \nTwo months ago I managed to detect that Amazon was actually a/b testing the removal of the second \"Buy Now\" button on a specific product page. Finally today it looks like the experiment has completed with both buttons still being displayed - like in the old days.

What I really don't like is when people use an \"It depends\" answer to protect themselves from making any falsifiable prediction / hypothesis - a safe escape mechanism. \n\nIt depends answers can be really useful if its conditions are made explicit and one person in particular who did elaborate on his answer was Tim Stewart - thank you a thousand for doing this.

I went through some of his conditionals and I'll try to summarize them as follows: \n\nIF customers are ready to add-to-cart AND might want to add multiple items then a grid might be better - encouraging more purchases and a greater AOV (average order value).\nIF customers are looking for more information AND might want to purchase a single item then a list might be better due to easier comparisons (assuming more information is needed and presented on the list).\nGENERALLY however, Tom van den Berg from Online Dialogue also hinted that in most of their a/b tests, lists have outperformed grids.\n\nOf course, as with all of our patterns, with each new piece of evidence we'll continue updating what we know.

Specifically, is it better to include a choice label (ex: the color name, the quantity amounts, etc) inside the button or leave them outside as a subheadline? \n\nAlthough the referenced experiment did not control for this change (both the control and variation only used image thumbnails), I did find other products (outside this experiment) that did show labels inside the buttons. These included: book formats and product dimensions. I'll leave this as a a question, but am subtly leaning or hypothesizing that labels might be good. \n\n\nWhat About Multiple Options?\nFinally, looking through more products, I did notice another set of more complex products with at least 2 dimensions of choices. Usually in these more complex situations, the products did not show the prices. Hypothetically, it might be that showing too many conflicting prices is too confusing in such contexts. A better approach might be to simply show one price total in this case. Although it would be more interesting to see an actual experiment like this."

The variant (uhm similar to our search concept from 2 months earlier) removed one layer of this UI compexity by exposing two \"+\" and \"-\" controls beside each guest type (adults, children) and room count.\nThen when we checked for traces of this experiment in early March, it became clear that Booking decided on and implemented version B (as predicted by this evidence-based pattern). \nGlad it worked out for their team and that we were able to learn a little something from their wonderful a/b test.\nThanks Booking! :)"

Notice how they actually provide the answer to that question by showing a dollar amount.  \nComparing this to Airbnb, I'm going to make a hypothesis that Booking's headline is rather shallow. Airbnb on the other hand makes a deeper promise of actually earning money. Comparatively, the value is demonstrated but not delivered just yet (it requires more action first).",
                "Artificial Vs Useful Questions\nIn the variant (B), Booking then shows a city field which plays a role in affecting the promised dollar amount that a landlord could generate on a monthly basis. And then, Booking also asks potential landlords how much they would like to charge their guests per night. I suspect this to be the root cause of why the experiment might have broke down for two reasons:\n1) Showing the day rate ($100) and the monthly earning potential ($1500) together might hint at questions. If someone does some rapid math ($100 day rate x 30 days = $3000), then this simple calculation might make it seem that Booking takes 50% of the revenue. This of course is not true, but it could be subtly implied.\n2) More so, asking users about their desired day rates and then using that to project monthly income, doesn't feel like users are being educated about their potential. Instead, this feels like the calculation itself is really on the user to figure out on her/his own. \nComparing this to Airbnb, they ask about 3 critical factors that influence the projected price: location, the type of apartment (room, full, shared, etc) and number of guests. Using this, they provide a more realistic price range. Airbnb educates potential landlords, without raising eye brows over how big of a cut they will take. To me thats's a solid approach.",
                "Orphaned Elements\nHere I just wanted to criticize the quality of the implementation - orphaned elements. We can see two unnecessary and wasteful line breaks before elements that could be tighter (the \"?\" tooltip, and the word \"earning\"). Such orphaned elements may hint at a subtle sloppiness to some picky designers, but more specifically they may also push the call to action lower. Could this have played some microscopic role in the measured effect?",
                "Subtle Next Step\nFinally, in the B variation, Booking swapped the first price discoverability component with the next step of the registration process - containing the name and email fields. From what I remember about the experiment, there might not have been any way to move back (if someone wished to adjust anything for whatever reason). Such an inline change also raises questions about \"perceived progress\" - do users really see that they went to step 2 after submitting a form? Not sure.\nWhat we do know comparatively, is that Airbnb uses a clearer and more dramatic modal for their next step. This might have the added benefit of 1) being able to collapse ihe model and move back a step, as well as 2) hinting about progress more visibly. Here is what the step 2 modal looks like on their site:"

Hopefully my write up here hasn't suggested otherwise nor is perceived as shameful in any way. If/when we attempt to copy each other, we are being human, we're social, and we are attempting to learn from each other. :) I personally look up to leaders everyday, including both Airbnb and Booking. Both companies have detected some really interesting and intelligent UI improvements through experimentation. With that, I really hope that Booking.com attempts this experiment one more time - perhaps with some of the above suggestions in mind? I feel there is more upside to be copied. :)"

The graph showed a series of refund scenarios someone might be eligible for relatively to the check-in date (usually shrinking over time). Fast track into the future and there is no more sign of this variant as it returned into its collapsed state hiding from view. As far as we are concerned this means one thing - the experiment failed. At least, lucky for us, it failed to beat the control which is a necessity for implementation for a rational design process like Airbnb's. Here are my thoughts as to why this might have turned out so:",

Flip to the variant (B) and the story is inversed with people seeing the risk of losing 50% of their deposit within 48 hours. If people are loss averse, then this alone could have dragged the whole experiment down frightening a portion of users away.",
                "Two Confusing & Opposing Reference Points\nThe graph shows information with two reference points which is ripe for confusion. First, readers are asked to evaluate \"their eligible scenario\" from the present time of booking (see the \"Reservation confirmed\" reference on the left with the \"48 hours later\".). Then, at the same time information is also shown relative to the future check-in time (see \"Check-in\" on the right). This creates immense ambiguity. For example, if a check-in date is tomorrow but the reservation was made today, are users eligible for a full refund or no refund at all?\nA better approach would have been to pick a single time frame and display all information accordingly to avoid such confusion.",
                "Lack Of Specific Dates & Times\nWhen information is presented relatively as 14 or 7 day references, users need to do the intense calculations themselves. It would have been more beneficial if specific dates and times were added to clarify the key date points. For example: \"7 day before check-in\" could also have appended a specific date and time such as \"Fri June 7th, 14pm+\". I suspect that hour references in this contexts could be important to clarify.",
                "Misaligned Labels And Descriptions\nNotice that the time labels are shown as points along a line and yet the actual eligibility is a time frame. More so, the above variation also doesn't follow a consistent application of the labels (the \"48 hours\" label applies leftwards and the \"7 days\" label applies rightwards). This is a case of informational mismatch. I suspect that the labels should be aligned closer together with their corresponding descriptions for even less ambiguity.\nOverall, given that experiments run for weeks, it probably is worth to fine tune them a bit more before launch. This can increase their odds of success and minimize failures (easier said than done). With some adjustments perhaps this experiment might still have some remaining potential for a greener outcome. :)"

Although the two column layout was arguably more beautiful with the addition of white space, margins and shadows, it was nevertheless rejected. Before it was removed we decided to leak it here to ensure its beautiful failure continues to teach us well into the future. Finally, you might also notice that this leap experiment introduced multiple changes. Given that we track the win/lose rates of some of these changes as patterns, we can infer that Amazon introduced a mixed bag of both negative and positive changes at the same time - the exact mistake that often destroys such well-intentioned and beautiful redesigns.

I have no evidence on this, so I do not know.",

We're starting to understand that lowering buttons is most likely worse, while increasing their size is most likely better - and Amazon has combined such positive and negative changes together, potentially canceling them out.",
                "Lowered Product Description ... And Everything Else\nThe B variation lowered the product description below the product photo. More so, to minimize lowering all other information (ex: upsells) a partial collapse was introduced with an expandable \"More\" interaction. Nevertheless all other content below was pushed down. I'll stay neutral on this change as I'm really not sure what kind of impact this might have had, if any.",

In fact, I strongly believe that companies should run such experiments. The key thing of course is to make a solid assessment of what you know and what you don't know. Afterwards only group the positive probability changes into your big leap variation, while pushing all unknowns into separate variations that can be tested in the future. And how can you tell what has positive or negative probability? Keep track of your winning and losing experiments or use the evidence-based patterns we already track for you from numerous companies that are nice enough to share."

Showing more photos has been somewhat challenged by the Single Focus Photos pattern. While at the same time, we also have some emerging positive evidence in favor of showing more Product Previews (inline with Airbnb's decision to go towards this direction).",

Two similar section were grouped closer together with more consistency, ending with 3 high level items: entire guest suite, great check-in experience, and superhost status. The \"home highlights\" filler section title was removed, while the benefit-oriented one \"Entire guest suite\" appeared. Borders were dropped.

The breadcrumb also allows moving backwards to any of the previous levels by clicking on the links (Home, Canada, Ontario, Toronto, etc.) Classic stuff.\nThe B variation also had this functionality, but additionally, it displayed a secondary category (stay types) for each geographic level, turning this into a two-dimensional breadcrumb.\nWhy might have the B version failed? There might be numerous reasons and I'll try to list them out here.\nFor one, perhaps the B breadcrumb added way too much cognitive complexity by displaying numerous \"Hotels\" links everywhere. If users started searching by their preferred geographical context, the added stay types might have added confusion. While clicking on any \"Hotels\" link, users are forced to make a double choice (geography + stay type) with a single click. \nSecondarily, this approach also diluted the greater clarity of the traditional breadcrumb that answers \"where a user is currently in\".\nFinally, perhaps because the conventional breadcrumb is so widely used across so many other sites, users might have been expecting the simpler approach. \nOf course, let's keep in mind that trying to dissect and explain experiments post-hoc should be considered more hypothetical than definitive. It's easy to point fingers. Seriously, hats off to Booking for trying something more riskier for us to learn from. :)"

                "Multiple Host Videos\nThe next major difference in the variation (B) was the introduction of around 4 short and silent host introduction videos. The right side of the header would play these short videos of smiling hosts that would delicately introduce themselves - along with their names and location. An amazing way of reinforcing the new headline while showing a wider variety of different hosts from around the world.",
                "Right Aligned And Changed Call To Action Button\nThe primary sign up button shifted from left to right, while changing to \"Try hosting\". If the animating videos gain more attention, then this seems like a reasonable change to send some of that attention to the button as well.",
                "Stronger Reassurance Copy\n\"Your next chapter made possible by hosting\" doesn't really say much on the control. The variation is more precise and reassuring by stating that \"You can host anything, anywhere.\"",
                "More Testimonials\nThe control has one testimonial. The variation splits this into at least 3 visible ones (4th cut off by intention to signal a scrolling interaction). Are more testimonials better? :) I think so.",
                "Lowered Earning Calculator\nThe earnings calculator has been lowered further down and it's font increased. The call to action was also expanded from 1 to 2 (\"host your space\" and \"host your experience\").",
                "Lower Secondary Calls To Action\nIn the variation, all secondary calls to action (leading to educational or support pages) were moved from the top or middle of the page, to the bottom. This way, more of the upper and core landing page is dedicated to getting new hosts to sign up. Although we've never yet tested such a concrete move, we do have a few related experiments around the topic of surfacing educational content.",
                "Removed Newsletter Signup\nFinally, we can see that the newsletter signup form was removed. This keeps the focus of the landing page to the primary call to action of signing up new hosts - possibly related to the pattern of tunneling."
