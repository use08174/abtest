        "raw_contents": "About Designboost\nLong landing pages versus short landing pages is a debate that is as old as the Internet itself. The moment someone decides to sell his wares online, the dilemma arises: given the less attention span, should he be giving specific information about the product and getting to the point quicker or should he try to make a convincing case first and then persuade the visitor to make a purchase? Actually, it’s a central problem of persuasion and marketers battle with the question of ‘how much information is enough‘ every single day in their jobs.\nWhat if you are not selling, but actually giving out something for free? Free as in free beer. Do you still need long landing pages to convince people to take up a free offer? I realize that on the Internet, even freebies have to be sold but the question is how hard should you try?\nThat’s what one of Designboost intended to find out. They hired Markitekt to design and run an A/B test by using VWO.\nGoals\nDesignboost.net is a brand new website, so this is just the beginning of a long conversion optimization process that intend to partake. For the home page, they needed to figure out what works best for the audience. MarketIt tells us that in their past tests, they have consistently seen short home pages outperform long home pages if the offer is free (that is, email sign-up). So, they wanted to see if a shorter home page will outperform longer one here as well.\nTests run\nIt is worthwhile to note here that even though Designboost’s experience suggested that a short home page would work better, they didn’t go ahead and implement it directly. Instead, they did the right thing and A/B tested their hypothesis.\nThis is how the long version of the home page appeared:\nThis is how the trimmed shorter version of the home page appeared:\nConclusion\nThe shorter home page got 13% more email sign-ups and 25% more click-throughs to the courses page. Their comment on the test results: “If the goal of a page is to get email sign-ups or to get people off the home page, shorter pages can work better.”\nNeedless to say, Designboost are happy with the results and as they said, this is just the first step in their journey toward a full conversion rate optimization nirvana on their website!\nHow has your experience been for short landing pages or long landing pages? Which ones work best for you?",

        "raw_contents": "About Truckstop.com\nFounded in 1995 by Scott Moscrip, Truckstop.com started by offering a better way for truck drivers to find loads than by posting signs on the side of their trucks or gathering around local bulletin boards. Guided by the idea – always work to find a better way, today Truckstop.com has reached new heights with its 400+ dedicated partners working to help truck drivers and their trusted freight partners grow their businesses in 7 locations worldwide.\nTruckstop.com follows an established culture of experimentation within the organization for all its CRO exercises. We got in touch with Kevin Gamache – Senior Web Analyst, and Tara Rowe – Digital Marketing Program Manager,  at Truckstop.com to learn all about how they used multiple capabilities of the VWO platform like session recordings, learnings and A/B test for Truckstop’s website optimization.\nVWO has been a great tool for our company! The insights we’ve gained through our testing process has expanded our business and led to smart conversion-enhancing decisions.\nKevin Gamache\nSenior Web Analyst\nGoals\nTruckstop.com has two main target audience: the freight owners and agents who are very tech-savvy and the truck drivers who are not as tech-savvy. All the tests are designed keeping in mind these two personas so they can provide a seamless experience to customers of both spectra.\nApart from their overarching goal of a double-digit increase in revenue, Truckstop.com set two specific goals to meet:\nIncreasing online Sales – the KPI tracked for this goal was the revenue increase per month.\nDemo request for lead generation – the KPI tracked for this goal was the number of leads coming in for their sales team.\nTo achieve these goals, Truckstop.com set out to run the two campaigns discussed here to generate more MQLs through increased demo requests.\nTests run\nTruckstop.com follows a continuous optimization process and VWO helped it lay down the foundations of this experimentation culture through the plethora of user research and analysis tools that we offer. They have a dedicated CRO team of 4 professionals and call themselves the Truckstop Experimentation team.\nThe highlight of all the campaigns run by Truckstop.com was that they extensively used the VWO Session Recording capability to understand user behavior on their website. They looked at 1000+ recordings to gather significant user insights for every campaign.\nIn 2018, the Truckstop Experimentation team, despite much reluctance, tested pop-up forms on their website for both their target personas. As is believed, the team thought that the test would fail as there is barely anyone who likes pop-ups on websites.\nKeep reading to know if this assumption was correct or if the data from the test suggest otherwise. Let’s have a look at two campaigns run by Truckstop.com that reinforces what CRO preaches.\nCampaign 1: Demo Pop-up – Load board for Brokers (2018)\nHypothesis: A pop-up demo form will help produce more MQLs.\nGoal:  Increasing demo requests.\nSolution: The original page did not have a highlighted demo request form. The Experimentation team decided to test a pop-up demo request form on its broker load board page. This is what it looked like:\nResult: Contrary to what the team was expecting, after the completion of the A/B test, the variation resulted in a 26% uplift in conversions and beat the control. Control was at 64.96% conversion rate while variation was at 81.71%.\nCampaign 2:  Demo Pop-up – Load board for Carriers\nHypothesis: A pop-up demo form will help produce more MQLs.\nGoal: Increasing demo requests.\nSolution: The Truckstop Experimentation team conducted a similar test for their Carriers load board page. With the same dislike for pop-ups, they decided to test the pop-up demo request form for carriers. Only, in this case, 2 variations were created.\nVariation 1 had the same pop-up form as campaign 1 and this is what it looked like:\nVariation 2 had a CTA that read “Looking for a demo?” at the bottom of their Carriers load board page. This is what it looked like:\nResult: Here too, dismissing all personal opinions and likes and dislikes, variation 1 performed better than control or variation 2 with and resulted in an 11% uplift in conversion rate.\nUsing visitor recordings\nOver a period of 6 months, the Truckstop Experimentation team went through 1000+ recordings not just for insights to aid their test campaigns but to improve their overall UX. Here is a snippet of our conversation with Tara Rowe:\nQ. How many and what were your observations from these recordings?\nTara: We were able to determine where people dropped off on the application due to UX issues and bugs.  With this information, we were able to update our application process and help improve our conversion rate by over 25% of our previous conversation rate.\nQ. How many and what changes did you make based on these recordings?\nTara: It was great to be able to see the platform (PC, MAC, Mobile) that the customer was using.  We were able to determine if issues were platform specific and adjust the process as needed.\nQ. What improvements did you observe owing to these changes?\nTara: We saw a dramatic decrease in errors especially on mobile, we also saw a 137% increase in form completion rate due to changes made from this process.\nQ. Any screenshots of the forms you changed – before & after?\nTara: Most changes were on the back end in error coding and so no screenshots are available.\nAs the project manager for our experimentation process, I love how the functionality of VWO allows us to get up and going quickly but also gives us the flexibility to be more complex with our testing.\nTara Rowe\nDigital Marketing Program Manager\nConclusion\nConversion rate optimization is not an isolated process. Following a structured CRO program involves visitor research, hypothesizing, prioritization, testing, deployment and drawing learnings from concluded tests. And Truckstop.com exemplified how one should evangelize CRO. In the campaigns discussed here, CROs core beliefs were reinforced:\nNo place for personal opinions. Only data matters.\nTesting before deploying.\nTesting for different personas and target audience based on their needs and how they interact with your website.\nResearch and testing for even the most minute changes: both front-end and back-end.\nFollowing what CRO preaches, Truckstop.com was able to increase their conversions by simply A/B testing an idea that nobody thought would work.

        "raw_contents": "About Reassured\nAn award-winning life insurance broker in the UK, Reassured specializes in arranging suitable life insurance and funeral cover for families across the country. They are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and have helped protect more than 1,000,000 families. That’s not all – their broker service is completely fee-free! They compare quotes from a range of leading insurers to help their clients find the right cover and make a fully-informed decision without incurring any costs.\nThe CRO team at Reassured uses VWO for all experimentation needs.\nMy overall experience with VWO has been positive, especially with the fast response to questions and support requests.\nFred Ishola\nCRO Manager\nWe discussed a recently conducted successful experiment with Fred to get insights into the organization’s optimization framework.\nThe goal\nThe team ran a series of experiments with a singular goal in mind – to optimize their ‘compare life insurance quotation’ form by improving user experience. They wanted to get more visitors to progress through the user journey and increase the percentage of people submitting the insurance quotation form. In order to achieve this, the team wanted to improve the experience for those landing on the form.\nObservations\nBased on previous experience, the team observed that a multi-step form worked better for visitors as opposed to a long form with most fields listed on the same page. They decided to test if a multi-step form would improve the user journey for their target audience.\nTests run\nPreviously, Reassured’s life insurance quotation forms required the visitors to complete a long form which could look overwhelming to potential customers before they could request a quote. In the multi-step form that the team tested, the form was divided into stages with one response requested in a single step. A progress bar was added to the top of the form to indicate to users how close they were to completing the process.\nThis is what the control and variation looked like:\nThe goal tracked was the number of visits to the ‘Thank you’ page as that indicated successful form completion. The test was concluded in close to five weeks. \nIn comparison to the control, the variation with the multi-step form showed an improvement of 31.23% in form completion as tracked by visits to the ‘Thank you’ page. \nFred and his team were able to slice and dice the test results using VWO to understand that the conversion of desktop visitors was higher in this particular test – the fact that they no longer needed to scroll down a long page helped more of them submit it successfully. \nVWO’s advanced reporting capabilities help you analyze your campaign performance in a way that helps you uncover hidden winners. Find out if a specific segment of your visitors converted drastically different than the average case for a specific goal or variation. Take an all-inclusive free trial to explore this in detail.\nConclusion\nBased on the test results, the team carried out further research with VWO’s Form Analytics and Session Recordings to identify form questions that had a high dropoff rate. This led to a hypothesis to test alternative ways of helping visitors to the form understand why those questions were being asked and also make it easier to understand the options available. These ideas were then A/B tested. This in turn improved the conversion rate of not only this quotation page but also other brand pages. ",

        "raw_contents": "About Human Interest\nBased in San Francisco, Human Interest is assisting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in offering affordable and high-quality 401(k) plans to their employees.\nThe company is committed to solving America’s retirement crisis and aims to reach more SMBs to help them create a happy post-retirement life for their employees. The CRO team at Human Interest, consisting of the Vice President – Growth, Growth Product Manager, and Digital Marketing Manager, is responsible for improving the user experience and conversions on their website.\nWe recently discussed this team’s experience with VWO and the results they achieved.\nWhy VWO\nThe Human Interest team was looking for a server-side experimentation platform offering a smooth and easy-to-use integration with Contentful, which they found with VWO. \nWith the VWO-Contentful native integration, Human Interest could create different versions of content in Contentful and A/B test them using VWO. Secondly, this integration reduced the marketing team’s high dependency on engineering resources for running experiments.\n  “The VWO-Contentful Integration was the biggest feature that appealed to us. We previously used engineering resources to launch every server-side A/B test. Given our team’s large ambitions and limited engineering resources, we could only launch ~1 test every 14-20 days. With the VWO-Contentful integration, we removed the engineering dependency for setting up and launching front-end experiments.”\nNijanth Velmanikandan\nGrowth Product Manager at Human Interest\nGoal\nThe team at Human Interest built many landing pages for their paid campaigns on Contentful and wanted to explore ways to increase these pages’ conversion. Here, the conversion was a lead contacting the sales team. Their idea was to experiment with the landing page structure to improve the number of sales calls scheduled via the contact form.\n  Hypothesis\nThe team at Human Interest believed that embedding the contact form directly on the masthead of their campaign page would make it easier for a visitor to get in touch with the sales team. They wanted to test this against having a CTA button to send a visitor to their lead form.\nTests run\nThe team uses VWO FullStack to run server-side experiments. The reason for choosing VWO FullStack was its low latency experience and its native integration with Contentful CMS. With VWO’s server-side capabilities, the experiment is unnoticeable to the website visitor and has minimal impact on page load time.\nThis is how the Human Interest team step up their test:\nThey created the variation in Contentful – a CMS they are already familiar with. This variation included the contact form above the fold of the landing page. \nThe original page (control) with the CTA to the contact form along with the variation then simply had to be linked to the VWO app. Linking VWO with Contentful is native and once the integration is enabled, the landing pages can be connected to the VWO campaign in Contentful’s interface. The team then set up the test on VWO using the landing pages from Contentful with the targeting conditions on VWO. \nDue to the integration, the A/B testing campaign was fetched from VWO and the traffic allocation for the two versions was also visible in Contentful. The test was then launched without any context-switching between platforms.\n  Here’s how the control and variation looked:\nHere, the primary goal was tracking the number of form submissions. The secondary goal was the number of calls scheduled by the prospective leads with the sales team at Human Interest.\nThe test results validated the hypothesis that was put forward. For the primary goal, the variation had an expected conversion rate of 3.77%, which was 75.84% more than the control’s conversion rate.\nThe secondary goal also saw an uplift in the variation. The expected conversion rate for the secondary goal was 2.05%, a massive improvement of 84.43% from the baseline.\nWith the native integration of VWO with Contentful, it only took a few clicks in Contentful to publish the winning variation. \nConclusion\nThe confidence achieved from this one experiment catapulted the Human Interest team’s experimentation journey and they replicated the winning experience on other landing pages too.\nBefore partnering with VWO, the team could run 1-2 tests per quarter, but post-VWO adoption they are on track to run 15 tests in a quarter. The increase in testing velocity is sure to bring more positive results for Human Interest. \nVWO Fullstack is a complete server-side optimization solution that runs omnichannel experimentation and allows complex testing at various stages of product development.

        "raw_contents": "About EnergySage\nEnergySage, a U.S.-based marketplace, connects consumers seeking clean energy solutions with vetted local installers and providers. \nShoppers can easily obtain quotes from multiple pre-screened installers, often at prices 20% lower than what they would find outside the marketplace. \nFor installers, EnergySage provides access to thousands of motivated shoppers, streamlining the sales process through a single platform. This partnership helps clean energy companies grow their businesses efficiently.\nWhen it comes to experimentation, the company takes actionable steps by crowdsourcing ideas across the company and conducting competitor research. They analyze the practices of leading companies like Booking.com and TripAdvisor to continuously generate innovative concepts. \nAdditionally, they have dedicated team members who monitor the weekly testing pipeline, ensuring accountability and maintaining momentum, which drives their commitment to continuous improvement.\nWhy VWO\nOverall, the feedback is positive. The responsiveness of the team (CSM, support, having access to technical teams and their leads, and using Slack to quickly jump in) is awesome. I feel that I am such an advanced power user now that I help colleagues set up things extremely complicated things. VWO is a very powerful tool. All in all, I had a very good experience. \nLuke Richardson\nStaff Product Manager, Growth\nGoals\nWhen a user signs up on the EnergySage platform, they immediately receive a verification email as part of the onboarding process.\nThis email includes a “Verify Email Address” button that the user must click to be approved for the marketplace. The email concludes with a generic sign-off from the EnergySage team, representing the company but lacking a personal touch.\nTherefore, it was decided to test whether adding a team member’s name to the verification email would affect user engagement and verification rates.\nThere were three specific goals to be tracked: \nApproval of properties:\nThe main metric focused on increasing the number of approved properties, ensuring more shoppers considered solar solutions.\nRegistrations: \nLuke and his team would monitor the number of user registrations to assess overall interest and engagement with their offerings.\nEngage installers: \nThis metric evaluated how well installers engaged with the platform, ensuring that high-quality, motivated shoppers were matched with serious providers.\nObservations\nThe EnergySage team gathered qualitative data that led to this improvement idea. Feedback from customers indicated that speaking to real people made them more likely to “go solar” with the company. \nMany emphasized that having in-house energy advisors enhanced their trust and confidence in the process. Further, those who interacted with these advisors were much more likely to become paying customers. \nThis insight led the team to believe that adding a personal touch to the verification emails could similarly boost user engagement and trust.\nHypothesis\nThe hypothesis was that improving the email sign-off with the name of an actual team member would make the email feel more personal. \nThis human touch was expected to build greater trust in the brand, leading to higher verification rates.\nTests run\nLuke and his team decided to conduct an A/B test on the server side using VWO for two main reasons: \nTheir previous tool required a reverse proxy, which didn’t comply with their security protocols. Thus, they needed a solution like the SDKs offered by VWO. \nPage speed was a crucial factor in their decision-making. VWO’s minimal impact on load times made it an ideal choice, especially given the company’s reliance on SEO.\nTo implement the test, one of their engineers integrated their email automation tool with VWO. This enabled different email templates from HubSpot to be served to various users, addressing the server-side requirements.\nVWO seamlessly integrates with major platforms to enhance overall marketing activities. (Check out our list of integrations.) \nHere are the control and variation images for the test. \nThe primary funnel metric for the campaign was property approvals, representing users successfully reaching the marketplace.\nAfter two weeks, the variation led by 5%. Ultimately, the overall funnel saw a 4% improvement, which significantly impacted company revenue.\nConclusion\nThis success story highlights the importance of the human touch in driving customer engagement.\nEnergySage’s success stemmed from applying user insights to make their emails more effective by simply using the name of a team member. They also prioritized testing to validate their hypothesis rather than making changes outright.\nData-driven decisions are key to continuous improvement, as demonstrated by EnergySage.\nAre you ready to optimize for better conversions? VWO is here to assist you with research and testing through its wide array of capabilities. Connect with our team, and let them guide you in making informed decisions.",

        "raw_contents": "About ISM eCompany\nA full-service digital commerce agency headquartered in the Netherlands, ISM eCompany is most renowned for its future-proof and distinctive data-driven digital marketing services for eCommerce websites. ISM eCompany has been in the market for 28 years and is backed by 150 plus specialists. It also has a vast clientele that typically includes brand manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers with domestic and global digital commerce ambitions.\nISM eCompany has been using VWO since 2011 for all its A/B testing and conversion optimization needs. We got in touch with Loef Kleinmeijer, Team Lead Conversion & CRO Consultant at ISM eCompany, to learn about his experience with VWO and share some of his learnings.  \nLoef has run many experiments for many of ISM eCompany’s clients using VWO. One of these experiments, with a European telecommunications operator Tele2, is elaborated here.\nGoals\nTele2 is one of the leading Dutch-based mobile subscription service providers headquartered in the Netherlands. The company’s primary objective is to offer the best mobile subscription plans to its customers. It also aims to make it easy and convenient for visitors to find their preferred mobile devices and increase subscriptions on its product listing pages.\nObservations\nIn an in-depth conversation with Loef and his team, the execs at Tele2 expressed their concerns regarding the decreasing subscription rate on Tele2 product listing pages. To understand the problem, Loef and his team referred to multiple data sources, including neuro research, user tests, and web analytics data. \nThe insights from the research revealed that most people scrolled through the entire product listing page to look for their preferred smartphone brand rather than using the filter option present right above the mobile device listing. \nTests run\nBased on their research, Loef and his team hypothesized that adding brand filters next to the general filter button on the smartphone overview page will increase the number of visitors who continue to move ahead in the order-flow and the configuration page for renewal. This, in turn, will also cause an increase in the conversion rate. \nTo validate their hypothesis, ISM eCompany used VWO Testing to create a new version of the smartphone overview page. As discussed, they added brand filters next to the general filter in the variation version.\nHere’s how the control and variation looked like:\nThe test was run for 28 days and saw an uplift in both filter usage and subscription sales. They registered a 13.7% increase in conversion rate for new subscriptions and a 27% increase in conversion rate for existing customers renewing their subscription. \nThe team noted that by giving the brand filters a more prominent position on the smartphone, the overview page stimulates users to filter and narrow down their selection. In this way, users can find the most suitable device quicker, which, in turn, prompts them to take the desired action faster.\nConclusion\nISM eCompany plans to scale and deepen its CRO programs based on its current strong data-driven way of working. This includes gathering even more insights from data on the entire customer journey (on- and off-site). These insights will serve as the starting point for optimization through A/B tests and other validation methods. The company also plans to gather more learnings per test by using additional metrics and segments, combining heatmaps and recordings with test variations, and linking everything together to increase their knowledge of human psychology and user behavior. To understand human psychology and user behaviour through these tests, start your free trial today.\nLoef and his team believe that such a methodology will allow them to run more tests on specific visitors segments and achieve an even higher success ratio and impact in these tests.\nVWO is a highly user-friendly and economical tool. It offers an intuitive user interface. It makes it easy to run experiments, gather customer insights, check for leakages in the sales funnels, looking at customer journeys using recordings, and conducting usability tests. The ease of segmenting the audience while creating ‘control’ and ‘variation’ is also something that makes VWO stand out.\nLoef Kleinmeijer\nTeam Lead Conversion & CRO Consultant\nIn the future, ISM eCompany intends to explore more of VWO’s capabilities and make it an integral part of its standard testing and optimization toolkit. So far, the company has used VWO to uplift the revenue of many of its clients and plans to continue doing so.\n   ",

It’s a platform for building websites, which is accompanied by several widgets that perform functions such as text insertion, videos, RSS feeds, and integration with various social networks. BaseKit aims to allow inexperienced users to create a website, without the need for technical knowledge in programming languages.\nGoals\nBaseKit wanted to increase the number of people who visit the Buy Now page after visiting their Plans and Pricing page, so this was the conversion goal measured in the test.\nTests run\nThe BaseKit team wanted to increase the number of visits to the pricing page.\n(For their follow-up tests, we recommended Basekit to use VWO’s revenue tracking feature to make sure that not only conversions but also total sales is measured for different variations. This would have also given a better idea of the performance of variation).\nThe traffic that arrived on the pricing page (which was tested) was primarily paid, so it was already focused and targeted.\nHere is how the pricing page originally looked like:\nOriginal Pricing Page\nRedesigned Pricing Page\nIn their own words, the variation had “Bolder, brighter, clearer pricing, nicer design, testimonial, more obvious currency selection.”\nHere’s how the variation looked like:\nRedesigned Pricing Page (25% Increase in Conversions)\nConclusion\nThe new design reached a 95% statistical significance within 24 hours. It was a consistent 25% improvement for the entire duration of the test. They weren’t surprised but were reassured to see that our improvements had the desired effect.\nAs a follow-up test, they are creating yet another redesign of this new pricing page and by the time you read this, must have already A/B tested this, and many such new ideas. (Continuous A/B testing is key to increasing conversions. Sometimes you get results, sometimes you don’t; but if you do lots of A/B tests, you are bound to see some improvements.)\nThis excellent A/B test shows that not just actual pricing details but also the design of the pricing page are important. So, when are you going to test your pricing page? (By the way, we are planning to test our pricing page too. Let us know in the comments if you have any ideas for improvement.)\nHugely valuable. I’ve been a fan of VWO for a long time and it was great to take it to a new brand and show how powerful, yet easy to use it is.\nChris Gilfoy\nHead of Search",

They detail further how they managed to increase conversions and reduce the bounce rate by making minor changes to the headline.\nGoals\nThe page in this case was the front page of the product category for men’s clothing.\nThe conversion goal was to get more visitors to add products into the shopping cart and to have fewer bouncing visitors from the test page.\nTests run\nWe tested the variations for the headline of the page. The original headline included only the text Men’s Clothing.\nThe winning test combination included the following text (free transcription from Finnish to English): Order Men’s Clothing easily for bargain prices.\nThe original version didn’t have any text under the headline. The Tulos team tried adding a short block of text that included a few links to best bargain products of this product category.\nAlso, the original text did not have any text about the bargain prices on the front page of this product category. So, the team thought it was obvious that this test variation would have a significant impact on the performance. They also tested how the mention of bargain prices would affect the bounce rate and engagement to adding products to the shopping cart.\nConclusion\nThe variation that included more selling headline and bargain text outperformed the original version by having a 127% improvement against the original plain version.\nKey Takeaway\nYou shouldn’t underestimate or rule out the value of great text content on product category pages of online stores.\nTeam’s Experience with VWO\nVWO was a great and easy to use tool for setting up A/B tests, without any technical installation issues.",

Led by Gary Marx, the agency thoroughly analyzes each client’s unique operations and delivers customized testing solutions to enhance key metrics such as average order value (AOV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), conversion rate (CVR), and more.\nWhy VWO\nVWO worked PERFECTLY. It enabled us to make all the changes we wanted rapidly, prove the value of our tests, and grow our client’s sitewide conversion by over 30% in a matter of months. We could not have achieved such growth without VWO.\nGary Marx\nFounder & CEO\nGoals\nThe agency wanted to run conversion rate optimization campaigns for Planoly, a software company based in Texas. It recognized the need to enhance the performance of its pricing page CTAs (Call-to-Actions) to generate more clicks. Additionally, the aim was to boost the number of sign-ups for the paid trials from their registration page.\nObservations\nThe team at the agency used VWO Insights to understand user behavior on the pricing page and registration page of Planoly, which led to some interesting insights.\nThe heatmap analysis identified that many users on the pricing page clicked on the “Pricing” tab in the navigation bar. Also, there was a 33% exit rate on the pricing page. While on the registration page, one in every four users clicked on the login button instead of the sign-up. \n  Hypothesis\nThe observations led to two separate hypotheses for the pricing page and the registration page. \nFor the pricing page, the hypothesis was to expect an uplift in the conversion rate of CTAs by improving page designs and showcasing the benefits of the pricing plans. \nFor the registration page, the hypothesis was to add testimonials along with achievements and remove undesired CTAs, anticipating an increase in sign-ups.\n  Tests run\nBased on the hypothesis, the team at the agency conducted an A/B test on the pricing page and the registration page.\nPricing page\nThe control featured three pricing columns: Starter, Growth, and Professional, displaying discounted pricing and monthly savings in dollars. All the plans had CTAs with the same style.\nThe variation also had three columns, but the page was redesigned to include a contrasting color, a different CTA style for the Growth plan, a heading emphasizing pricing plan benefits, and a discount on the annual plan with savings stated in dollars per year.\nThe test concluded with the variation outperforming the control. The variation showed improvements in CTA clicks for the Starter plan (16%), the Growth plan (20%), and the Professional plan (74%). It also resulted in a 38% increase in revenue and a 24% increase in average order value. \nRegistration page\nThe control had a simple three-field sign-up form with two CTAs one for signing up and the other for logging in. While the variation had a single sign-up CTA, along with badges displaying achievements and a testimonial.\nThe test ended with the variation outperforming the control. It resulted in a 17% increase in the number of paid clients, a 10% rise in the number of visitors on the billing step, and a projected 15% increase in revenue. Here is the report from the VWO dashboard:\nConclusion\nThe agency started by using VWO Insights to understand the existing user experience. It helped create a hypothesis, which the team tested using VWO Testing – Web. As a result, the agency significantly improved key metrics for Planoly and helped it achieve its business goals.\nTake a 30-day all-inclusive free trial of VWO to experience the comprehensive capabilities and to understand how you can easily run tests to achieve your business goals.

This success story draws upon what was originally written by Carlos Romero of QualityTraffic.\nGoals\nPluimen used its home page as the landing page for people who searched on Google for the term “gift voucher” and other closely related keywords. Pluimen’s marketing team wanted to explore ways to improve conversion to drive higher revenue. It wanted to increase revenue by boosting purchases.\nTests run\nThe original landing page had 2 call to action (CTA) buttons—one reading Buy Now and the other Check Experiences.\nThis is what it looked like:\nTo reach their goal, Pluimen’s team decided to modify the home page/landing page by minimizing the number of distractions on it. The intent was to draw more visitors into the sales funnel and then make them follow a straight path to look at the experiences that a Pluimen gift voucher offered.\nTheir hypothesis was that the original home page offered visitors too many choices, leading to confusion. The company hypothesized that reducing the number of CTA buttons and the number of links would lower the bounce rate and get more visitors into the sales funnel.\nTo test the hypothesis, a new landing page variation was created, with only 1 call-to-action button, that is, Check Experiences. The variation also had a significantly reduced number of links.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nQualityTraffic used the VWO platform to set up and conduct an A/B test. The A/B test ran for 47 days before it was concluded that the variation did beat the original landing page.\nConclusion\nThe hypothesis that reducing distractions would reduce the bounce rate was proved right. The test generated the following statistically significant results:\nBounce rate: –8.5%\nConversions: +10.9%\nTransactions: +11.4%\nRevenue: +19.7%\nSo, why did the variation deliver such a significant improvement?\nBy reducing the number of CTAs and links, visitors had fewer things on the landing page to focus on. They easily got to the Check Experiences CTA and on clicking this button, they got the social proof that gave the site credibility and encouraged them to finish their purchases.\nAccording to the research conducted by Iyengar & Lepper (When Choice is Demotivating: Can One Desire Too Much of a Good Thing?), it was found that more people would likely take a desired action if they are given lesser choices.\nThe average landing page has an attention ratio of 20:1. This means that there are 19 links that can potentially draw a visitor’s attention away from the one link or CTA button that has the highest priority for you (because it needs to lead to conversion).\nThe ultimate attention ratio is, of course, 1:1. Barry Schwartz, the author of The Paradox of Choice – Why More is Less, explains why fewer choices lead to faster decisions.",

        "raw_contents": "About Qualicorp\nQualicorp is a Brazil-based healthcare organization. The company focuses on administering and managing healthcare plans. They promote and sell group health and dental based insurances.\nQualicorp has been using VWO since 2015 and has been working actively on improving both mobile and web UX through VWO Testing & VWO Insights to achieve KPI goals. This has been immensely aided by VWO Services, the optimization consulting wing of VWO.\nGoals\nEconomize Qualicorp, the domain that recommends best insurance plans based on user inputs, is the main experimentation arena for Qualicorp, based on its high traffic and use case offered. The primary objective of the domain is lead generation and increasing conversions via the ‘Insurance quotation’ page (Dados Para Coatacao: Resultado and Request received pages*) for plans.\n*Resultado Page – Displays the list of health insurance plans based on user input values\n*Request Received Page – Confirms the interest of the user in an insurance plan\nObservations\nWith the aim to increase lead generation, Economize Qualicorp, took VWO Services’ guidance. Together, they made a few observations on the website:\nWhen users landed on the homepage, two fields were displayed – “name” and “date of birth” and on the 2nd step of the form, they were again asked to fill these pre-filled fields to complete the step. \nUsers were getting no results on the ‘Resultado Page’ when they selected the N/A option in the ‘Profession’ field. \nThe ‘count of plans available’ form field could be skipped, which should be a must fill for the users.\nThrough VWO form analysis, it was also realized that a major drop-off was happening while form filling. This was due to field names not being discernable at the time of form filling, leading to fewer users reaching the Resultado page.\nTests run\nEach of the above observations was tackled through different tests, each with a different objective.\nTest 1:\nSince users were already filling the fields such as “name” and “date of birth” on the homepage, it was decided not to ask for the same information in Step 2. It was hypothesized that fewer details requested from the users, may lead to an increase in the users landing on the Request received page.\nResult: The test ran for 14 days, with traffic being equally split between the control and the variation, with the entire traffic participating in the trial. The clicks on Primary CTA for form submission “Solicit Contato/Request Contact” improved by 24.68% with 100% significance and visits on Request Received Page improved by 19.31% with a 100% confidence level. \nTest 2:\nThe objective of this test was to improve both the quality and quantity of prospective leads moving from Resultado towards the Request received page.\nShowing more options in the ‘profession’ field instead of displaying ‘none’ in the field was seen as the solution to users not submitting this information.\nA variation was created where the “profession” field was made mandatory so that users could not proceed without filling it. This led to more qualified leads landing on the Request Received Page (Interest confirmation).\nResult: The campaign ran for 7 weeks, with traffic being equally split between control and variation. The visits on the Resultado page improved by 4.33% and visits on the Request Received Page improved by 12.52% with a 100% confidence level.\nSince the complete campaign displayed improvement in lead generation the variation was deployed on the site.\nVWO Insights lets you map the performance of your website forms to create seamless customer experiences. Take a free trial today to explore its features! \nTest 3:\nThe objective of this test was to improve the drop-off happening at Step 2 of the form and hence push more users down the conversion funnel, i.e. Resultado page. \nIt was hypothesized that showing field names to users at only the most pertinent moment as well as making it look less cluttered will help in improving the form submissions. \nA variation was created where once the user clicked on the field box, only then the field name would hover over the box, rather than being always-on. Field name font and size were also pruned and improved, so as to make them more legible. \nResult: This experiment ran for 12 days and with all traffic participating, equally split between the control and the variation. The variation won with a 16.93% jump in the primary goal, Visits to the Request received page, with 100% significance. The variation is now live for all the users.\nConclusion\nThe winning variations running on the website have made it more effective and seamless for users than before. The team is also more confident about the website’s performance since the changes have been made through testing, and the impact of each is better known. \nNeedless to say, having made a significant impact on the website experience, lead generations, as well as the lead form user journey from step 1 to request received page, the Qualicorp team has developed a lot of faith in the process of conversion rate optimization and the VWO Services’ guidance. Now their aim is to increase their testing velocity and be more data-driven, through closer working with VWO Services. You can also take a free trial with VWO to understand more about how we can help you build seamless experiences for your customers.\nWe have significantly enhanced our website’s user experience and have created a substantial positive impact with the enhanced quality leads. The VWO team has been helping across, right from GA reporting to superior testing and management services to providing thoughtful design inputs of our new site. For me, the most impressive aspects of the  VWO Services are communication and quick turnaround time.\nBeatriz Yanagui\nMarketing Analyst",

It provides faster ways to format, add links, upload media, and scale images so that you can focus on writing the best content. Hundreds of writers rely on Artsy Editor every day.\nFor their A/B testing (WordPress application), they chose VWO.\nGoals\nTheir hypothesis was that people want to see strong call-to-actions to try out demo and learn about our pricing before actually committing to purchase the product. The goal of their home page was to route more people to their demo and pricing page.\nTheir home page consisted of a call to action sandwiched between a headline and some screenshots of the editor.\nThey decided to A/B test this area on the home page and used VWO for the same.\nTests run\nThe Artsy Editor team tested whether a single button can concentrate more clicks or having 2 buttons with different contrast can give people more options to click. They also tested different phrases used in the buttons (revealing the price, mentioning the demo, and others).\nThey A/B tested 3 different button combinations:\nTry Demo & Buy Now for $19.99\nTry Demo for Free\nTry Demo for Free & Buy Now\nVariation 1 with a single demo button had a 5% improvement in click-through to their demo and 47% improvement in the click-through to their pricing page.\nThe surprising result here is that even though there wasn’t any Buy Now button, the Try Demo button (indirectly) improved conversions to the pricing page by 47%.\nHere’s how variation #1 looked like:\nVariation #1: 47% increase in clickthroughs\nTheir variation #2 with 2 buttons (with the emphasis on demo button) had a 7% improvement in click-through to demo and 17% improvement in click-through to the pricing page.\nVariation #2: 17% increase in clickthroughs\nVariation #3 had 2 buttons with the price written on the Buy Now button. Surprisingly, this variation had no real improvement in conversions.\nVariation #3: No improvement in click-throughs\nConclusion\nWhen we asked Artsy Editor about their biggest lesson learned from this A/B test, here is what they said:\n“One big lesson learned: for software product like us, the primary call-to-action should be the demo/trial, not the checkout/purchase. Because most of the visitors are first-time visitors and they want to focus on learning more about the product before making a purchase decision. If you push too hard at the beginning, they might feel distracted, uncomfortable and leave the site.“\nRegarding the tool they used, here is what they had to say:\n“We wouldn’t do anything similar without VWO. Both creating the test and checking results are done in few clicks.“\nArtsy Editor said they would continue to test other pages and elements as well, especially the pricing and checkout pages. If you sell software online, make sure you also A/B test your call to action buttons.\nIt can have a dramatic impact on your sales and conversions, just like it did for Artsy Editor.",

Its products are sold through major retailers around the world as well as through its website.\nTo improve the conversion rate of their website, the company hired Spot Studio, a digital agency focused on developing web solutions for generating profits.\nGoals\nThe main goal of this A/B test campaign was to increase Muc-Off’s sales by reducing user drop-off from the home page.\nTests run\nThe original web design featured information about Muc-Off at the user’s eye level. The purpose of this design was to engage users with the submenus that offered product use guides as well as links to buy them.\nThis is what control looked like:\nThe Spot Studio team felt that this design caused incongruity in user experience. Visitors came there to purchase products; but after landing on the page, they were finding information resources instead of a shop front.\nSpot Studio decided to tweak the design of the category page of Muc-Off’s online store to increase product views and maximize sales (conversion rate). The redesign was based on the hypothesis that by moving products above the fold, users would be encouraged to buy.\nThis is what variation looked like:\nEmploying heatmaps, analytic tools, and scientific statistical testing facilitated by VWO, user behavior and interaction were monitored on the original design as well as the new design in which above the fold content was replaced with eye-catching images of their products, complete with a slider. The test monitored aspects such as where users hovered, where they clicked and how far down the sales funnel they went.\nConclusion\nHaving rearranged the departments page, Muc-Off saw a dramatic increase in closed sales as well as product views. Moving product images to above the fold increased product views by 43.78% with a concurrent increase of 106.26% in sales.\n“We all know that user drop-off from the home page is a big issue suffered by a lot of businesses, with the bounce rate also taken into consideration as a SERP. The key is to make sure that your users are engaged as a lead as soon as they land on your website, ensuring that those who are there to purchase are immediately directed towards a sale. Utilizing striking imagery, which reinforced Muc-Off’s brand identity, was also a must. Just replacing the top of the page with products would have only alienated the user, thus creating incongruity in branding, which would in turn diminish trust. It’s that fine line between a push and a pull that we believe works so effectively in this case as we were not only selling a product, but a brand and a lifestyle.”\nSebastian Paszek\nSpotStudio",

The team operates on the philosophy: When in doubt, test! \nVWO is a great tool that helps us quickly experiment with new ideas, create a backlog for tests, and also run and execute them.\nAbhishek Pandey\nGrowth Hacker\nWe looked at one of the recently conducted successful experiments that fetched Kommunicate a 25% uplift.\nGoal\nThe Kommunicate team wanted to improve the visitor-to-sign-up conversion rate. With this goal in mind, they decided to test different versions of CTAs to increase the free trial sign-ups on their website.  \nTests run\nThe hypothesis was that removing the email address field from the CTA would increase the number of visits to the sign-up form and prompt more people to sign up for the product’s free trial. \nThe original home page of the website which became the control for this experiment had an email address input field next to the ‘Try for Free” button. For the variation, the team removed the email field and only retained the button CTA. \nThis is what the control and variation looked like:\nThe primary goal being tracked in the test was the number of clicks on the CTA button. The test was concluded in just 2 weeks. Variation 1 was declared the winner by VWO with a 25.53% increase in clicks on the ‘Try for free CTA’.\nConclusion\nThe team is running subsequent tests following this win to determine how the new CTA impacts the visits to the sign-up page and the number of form submissions. They are confident of improving the conversions on their website through this series of quick tests with VWO. ",

It is run by one of the biggest media houses in the country, Mediaworks.\nMediaworks took the Hungarian media world by storm and became the industry leader right from the moment they were established in late 2014. With over sixty media brands in their portfolio, they are the perfect amalgamation of traditional and new age journalism. On one hand, they own the most state-of-the-art newspaper printing press in Hungary. And on the other, they have a host of popular digital media services.\nStaying true to this philosophy, they also own Nemzeti Sport Online, around-the-clock sports online news service. The website also features interviews and blog posts by journalists and sportspersons.\nVisitors can comment, launch blogs, or upload sports videos and photos. Reports on important matches are presented alongside analysis of the most interesting stories unfolding in the world of sport. By publishing around 130 pieces of content- both text and video, each day, the website covers every major sporting event from around the world.\nGoals\nBéla, product manager with Nemzeti Sport Online, was looking for a communication channel that could increase pageviews by bringing users back to their website, daily. He was already aware of the capabilities of web push notifications. Hence, his mission was to find the best provider of this technology. After trying out VWO Engage, he was impressed with its easy success in realizing Nemzeti Sport’s end goals.\nCurrently, the website sends one notification a day. The editorial team identifies the most interesting and premium piece of content, and users are notified of it. Usually, the daily notification will be centred around reports, interviews, and summaries.\nTests run\nBéla soon discovered that, in comparison with their newsletter, push notifications were giving them much higher numbers on various counts. The subscriber list was growing faster and the click-through rate was more.\nThe average click rate they have received on their notifications is a massive 24.12%. Their best click rate so far is 29%. This shows that their strategy of using VWO Engage to get return visits has been working consistently well.\nWhen it comes to social media, Béla finds the number of visitors from these platforms much more quantifiable. However, the average number of page views generated from push notifications is double the number generated from readers visiting the website through social media.\nWhen visitors click through a notification which is delivered on their browser, the website sending it gets their almost undivided attention. This is unlike on social media where you have stories from multiple websites vying to get noticed.\nConclusion\nBéla is happy with the way VWO Engage is delivering the desired numbers. He has ambitious plans for putting the technology to further use in the future.\n“Going ahead, we want to use VWO Engage to support our native advertising solutions. We would like to use it to promote our other channels as well- newsletter, social media, etc. In fact, we are thinking about how can we use it to increase print sales!”\nApart from being delighted with the product, he is impressed with the service too.\nHe signs off from the interaction saying, “VWO Engage is a great enabler in bringing users back and distributing our selected content. And the effectiveness can be measured easily. As for the VWO Engage team, they are very flexible and helpful. They are available whenever required.”\nAccording to Bela:\n“VWO Engage brought us easy success in meeting our end goals, increasing page views and bringing users back to the website, every day.“",

Today, the online store offers a wide variety of authentic and trendy ethnic fashion ranging from sarees, salwar kameez, and lehengas to contemporary Indo Westerns as well as a great collection of accessories. Utsav Fashion’s vision is to provide the best online shopping experience and take the best of Indian Ethnic Fashion worldwide.\nUtsav Fashion has been using VWO Services for all its experience optimization needs since 2019 and has run many tests since. We got in touch with Shray, Product Manager, and Arvind Kumar, VP Engineering at Utsav Fashion, who are responsible for improving user experience and conversions on their website, to learn all about the recent wins they achieved.\nGoals\nThe overarching objective of Utsav Fashion testing is to improve conversions, on their ethnic fashion wear eCommerce mobile website for the U.S traffic.\nThe tests discussed here had increasing transactions as their goal, which would ultimately feed into the overarching objective of improving conversions.\nObservations\nFor the two tests discussed here, the challenges faced were unique:\nTest 1 Challenges\nData suggested that mobile traffic from the US had an alarmingly high, 67% cart abandonment rate. \nAfter initial research, the team noticed that there was no visible CTA to nudge users to complete the transaction. \nThey also observed that users were engaging heavily with the order summary, and as order summary was part of the page content, it served as a distraction more than a facilitator while users filled the checkout form fields.\nTest 2 Challenges\nThe hamburger menu registered 30% of the total clicks on the homepage making it one of the most important elements on the mobile site\nIn the current UI, users were finding it difficult to find the products they wanted\nThe interaction within the menu itself was very low as the listed options appeared as links with no further breakdown of options\nIn the control, sub-categories such as occasion, style, fabric were only available on the listings page. Users had to use listing page filters for every specific request (such as party wear saree or linen saree), increasing the time taken as well as the cognitive load on the users\nTests run\nThe team made a few changes to the original checkout page:\nThe main change was the primary CTA getting turned into a sticky bottom that also reflected the total order amount.\nThe new CTA text ‘View Details’, when clicked on, reflected the order summary.\nThe ‘Edit’ option from the order summary was also removed to eliminate the chance of users getting distracted from the primary CTA and ending up re-evaluating their carts\nHere’s a comparison image of the control and variation for your reference:\nResult: The test ran for 16 days and variation won with a 9.98% improvement in purchase conversions. Additionally, revenue increased by 8.95%.\nTake a free trial to know how A/B testing works.\nTest 2 – Testing a New Hamburger Menu Layout and Design\nObjective: Increasing the number of successful transactions\nHypothesis: Based on the above observations, the team hypothesized that improving the UI of the hamburger menu would increase its usage, leading more users to the product page, thereby, positively affecting both product discovery and eCommerce CVR. \nSolution: The team, before making changes to the original hamburger menu, used VWO Insights’ capabilities to assess how users were interacting with it. The element list capability offered under VWO Insights’ heatmaps showed that the hamburger menu registered 30% of the total clicks on the homepage:\nThey also ran a mobile heatmap analysis on the control hamburger menu and noticed that barring one element labeled Concepts, none of the other elements listed on the hamburger menu received any clicks on them:\nBased on all the valuable visitor behavior insights, the UI of the hamburger menu was redesigned with the introduction of sliding options that allowed users to see all the parent categories, their sub-categories, and all the options under those sub-categories. Here’s a comparison image of the control and variation for your reference:\nResults: The test ran for 14 days on all the pages of the mobile website and registered a staggering uplift of 11.58% in the conversion rate of purchases. Additionally, revenue increased by 12.22%.\nPost the completion of the test, a heatmap analysis of the variation showed that usage of the hamburger menu had drastically improved with the new UI:\nIt has been an exciting journey for us with VWO. The collaborative approach of the VWO Services team allowed Utsav Fashion to implement many features on our website based on customer behavior insights. The project forced us to deeply understand customer behavior and innovate fast. We successfully discussed, designed, and implemented a number of campaigns on their merit. I believe all these will help our customers immensely and make their buying journey enjoyable.\nArvind Kumar\nVP, Engineering\nConclusion\nIn collaboration with VWO services, through continuous analysis of visitor behavior on their mobile website and through targeted testing, Utsav Fashion was able to not only increase transactions but also as an effect, significantly increase its revenue by a great margin. These 2 tests resulted in an overall 10.78% increase in Utsav Fashion’s conversion rate.\nThe team’s utilization of VWO Insights’ capabilities, like heatmaps and elements list, gave them a clear view of the direction the tests needed to take. The insights generated thus not only gave them data based on their users’ experience and behavior but also provided scientific backing to the tests that were run.\nStart your free trial today to know how VWO can help you optimizing your website.",

However, some customers inquired about alternative payment options besides PayPal, which were available later in the checkout process. This setup seemed to cause confusion.\nHypothesis\nThe team at Serpent Forge hypothesized that if users were getting confused about payment options on the product page, then showing all available payment methods such as Apple and Google Pay, Mastercard, and Visa near the add-to-cart button would provide clarity.\nTests run\nThe hypothesis prompted the team at Serpent Forge to conduct an A/B test using VWO Testing on the product page. In the control version, the PayPal badge was placed directly above the add-to-cart button, whereas the variation showcased multiple payment options badges in the same position.\nThe test, which involved over 2600 visitors, concluded with the variation emerging as the clear winner. The variation resulted in an 82% increase in add-to-cart clicks, a 32% improvement in checkout page click rate, and a 2% increase in page engagement.\nConclusion\nWith the assistance of VWO, the Serpent Forge team successfully achieved their objective of boosting add-to-cart clicks and mitigating points of ambiguity on their website. \nIf Serpent Forge’s success has caught your attention and you’re curious about what VWO can do to uplift your conversations, sign up for a 30-day free trial and explore VWO’s extensive experimentation features.

Their shirt-making is inspired by Jermyn Street, home of traditional British shirt-making craft. Over time, the company expanded its range to include clothing for men and women. In addition to their brick-and-mortar stores, the company sells and ships products worldwide through its website thomaspink.com.\nGoals\nThomas Pink wanted to optimize their home page to boost online sales from the website. For this, the company hired Practicology, an independent eCommerce consultancy, who used VWO tools for the optimization process.\nTests run\nBased on consumer surveys and insights from their brick-and-mortar stores, Thomas Pink’s marketing experts concluded that visitors who engaged with the fitting room were more likely to turn into customers. Also, asking salesmen for shirts in particular styles and colors was an indication of the prospect’s intent to buy.\nAnother insight was that a large proportion of customers were repeat buyers. As Lee Howard from Practicology said, “Anything to aid them find a product quicker should help.”\nThis is what the home page originally looked like:\nThe team decided to make it easier for users to find what they were looking for (size, color, style, and others) by adding a “shirt finder” tool. This, it was felt, would help push more visitors into the sales funnel by replicating the salesmen and fitting room experiences online.\nTo simplify the look and feel of the home page and thus reduce distraction, the team also decided to remove the content-heavy middle section. This, in effect, would push up the product images and links.\nA new new version of the home page was developed. This is what the variation looked like:\nUsing VWO tools, an A/B test was run for 30 days, covering a total of 136,000 visitors to the website. The test tracked three goals: number of order confirmations (the primary goal), revenue (and revenue/visitor), and engagement.\nConclusion\nThe result confirmed their hypothesis about the value of the shirt finder. Visitors did find the shirt finder tool useful and going by the results, it clearly made the purchase process easier. The variation recorded 12.18% increase in purchases.\nThe absolute revenue for the new version also increased by 11.6%. The growth in revenue/conversion was 14.2%.\nThe test results also proved that customers of Thomas Pink did in fact care about ease of purchase. Introducing the shirt finder tool right on the home page made it easy for users to quickly get to their favorites so more people bought more shirts.\nThis particular test made 2 changes in the variation, so it was not possible to segregate the impact of each change.\nTo determine the exact contribution in the uplift of all the goals, a multivariate test—with total 3 variations and 1 control—would have been useful. This could make for a good set of next tests and also help build a strong experimentation knowledge repository.",

        "raw_contents": "About BluTV\nBluTV is Turkey’s leading subscription-based, over-the-top (OTT) video-on-demand service. Founded in 2015, BluTV offers a wide range of content, including award-winning original programs.\nWe spoke to Mustafa Esad Tatlipinar, who works as an Optimization Manager at Hype, a VWO Certified Partner performance marketing agency that BluTV hired for conversion optimization across its digital properties. Hype works with BluTV’s product team and has extensively used VWO to run A/B and Split URL tests on BluTV’s desktop and mobile websites.\nGoals\nBeing a subscription-based business model, BluTV’s success depends entirely on the number of active subscribers. Their primary objective was to get more of their website visitors to sign up for a paid subscription trial. To be able to start one, visitors must share their credit card information, and are charged only after they’ve completed a 7-day free trial.\nObservations\nHype began the process by conducting research into visitor behavior on BluTV’s website. On looking into the quantitative data from sources such as Google Analytics, the Hype team found that the conversion rate for mobile visitors was significantly low compared to their website average.\nRealizing that fixing the issue of low conversion rate for the mobile visitor segment could heavily impact their objective, Mustafa decided to dig deeper into it.\nWhile conducting visitor research, the two teams also used a third-party heatmaps tool to generate actionable insights.\nFrom their research, the Hype and BluTV’s UX team concluded that BluTV’s existing mobile home page is more focused on serving its active users and less on new visitors.\nTests run\nBased on this insight, BluTV and Hype decided to completely revamp its mobile home page. The team intended to address potential areas of improvement identified in the research, and then test those against the existing ones. While designing the new home page for mobile visitors, the BluTV team:\nRemoved all the distractions in the header section, keeping only the logo and sign-in link in the header. The team also included BluTV’s main value propositions, included information about pricing the hero section, and used animation for scrolling.\nPromoted some of the most popular content available in BluTV’s library for the next section.\nAdded an FAQs section at the end to answer any common queries from different visitors.\nThe Test\nHype decided to run a Split URL test for the new home page against the older version to see if it impacts BluTV’s conversion rate for mobile visitors. This is how the Original (existing home page) and Variation (new home page) versions looked like:\nOriginal\nVariation\nResult: Hype ran the test for a duration of 19 days and included 89,290 visitors. The Alternative variation increased the conversion rate by over 42%.\nConclusion\nThe success of this test validated the initial hypotheses and findings made by the teams, and BluTV went ahead with making the new home page live on its website. Since then, Hype has been using VWO regularly to conduct A/B tests on BluTV’s website to test new ideas and hypotheses.\nBluTV has many optimization opportunities with its OTT business model. We have been working with BluTV’s wonderful product, marketing and UX teams for their optimization needs for a long time. In our optimization process VWO has been our key tool to drive BluTV’s main goals. Thanks to its easy to use and powerful features, we increased mobile membership trial conversion rate by more than 40%.\nMustafa Esad Tatlipinar\nOptimization Manager\n(On behalf of BluTV)",

        "raw_contents": "About JellyTelly\nJellyTelly is an Internet-based television network for Christian families. They stream original videos and provide some children’s games.\nTo improve website conversions, the company hired Never Settle, a digital agency that regularly uses the VWO platform for its client work.\nGoals: Increasing Number of Visits to the Sign-Up Page\nJellyTelly is a membership-based site and thus its home page plays an important role in pushing prospects into the conversion funnel.\nThis is what JellyTelly’s original home page looked like:\nTests run: Eliminating Navigation Elements That Distract Visitors\nThe Never Settle team felt that there were too many elements on the home page site. So, they hypothesized that retaining only the content relevant for encouraging visitors to move into the funnel would be increasing visits to the sign-ups page.\nAccordingly, they created a variation of the home page with fewer elements. Specifically, the variation did away with 3 main elements that were on the original page:\nNavigation and character images on the top\nSearch box on the top-right\nLinks in the footer\nBecause a majority of visitors returning to the site were usually existing customers of JellyTelly, the conversion team at Never Settle used the segmentation feature in VWO to run this test only for new visitors.\nConclusion: 105% Increase in Visitors to the Sign-Up Page; Actual Sign-Ups Up by 5%\nThe variation with fewer distractions beat the original and sent 105% more visitors to the sign-up page. Kenn from Never Settle reported that this improved total sign-ups for JellyTelly by 5%.\nHere is the comparison image for easy reference:\nThe 105% increase is definitely valuable. However, considering that the number of people visiting the sign-up page from the home page doubled, the increase in sign-ups seemed relatively small. Therefore, the team planned its next round of tests to figure out what more could be changed to achieve a higher number of sign-ups.\nIt is important to get the navigation design of the site right. For some businesses, providing visitors with all options so they can explore the site based on their preferences works. But for others, doing so distracts visitors and lowers conversion rates. For these, leading prospects one step at a time is a better option.\nAnd there lies the key learning: Just because a certain A/B test improved conversions for one website does not mean it will do the same for every website.",

        "raw_contents": "About Ubisoft\nA leading creator, publisher, and distributor of interactive entertainment and services, Ubisoft has a rich portfolio of world-renowned brands in gaming. The teams throughout Ubisoft’s worldwide network of studios and business offices are committed to delivering original and memorable gaming experiences across all popular platforms.\nGoals\nAs the Associate Director of Digital Marketing, Jenny Hughes leads a team of web producers responsible for all of Ubisoft’s game marketing website and display media campaigns for North, Central and South America.\nWhile working on the digital marketing campaign for Tom Clancy’s The Division, Jenny’s team started investing a lot of resources into rich game information and interactive content on their marketing website to educate and spread awareness of their new IP. These sections had multiple updates throughout the course of the campaign, and Jenny saw an opportunity to be doing more than displaying a “COMING SOON” message to their website visitors. In fact, Ubisoft’s research has shown that the primary reason why people visited their website was to find more information about particular games offered by the company. \nThis is when they realized that Ubisoft needed to find smarter and faster ways to give quicker updates about various games to its subscribers.\nTests run\nThe team then discovered VWO Engage and decided to try it out for two months. After the trial, and happy with the results, they chose VWO Engage to be their push notification service provider.\nUbisoft’s primary goal of increasing the number of returning visitors to their websites was fulfilled with VWO Engage, whether that was to fuel consideration during a pre-launch campaign, or sustain player interest when new content become available in the game, post-launch.\nFrom push notifications, Ubisoft websites get an average click rate of 17%. This is a big deal compared to the average click rate of most emails, which is between 2 to 4%. VWO Engage doubled and even quintupled what Ubisoft’s initial expectations were!\nOne important aspect that Jenny’s team considered was the frequency at which they sent push notifications, which would be dependent upon the communication calendar of a given game. From a user experience perspective it was important to send only meaningful and valuable notifications to Ubisoft’s users, which nets out to be around 2 to 4 every week for games with healthy communication cycles. The team also observed that their highest click rate came from game announcements, with an astounding best click rate to be at 31%!\nThe push notification opt-in on Ubisoft websites\nConclusion\nWhat excited Jenny the most about push notifications is the line of personal, direct communication her team could now have with the subscribers. “Being able to talk to our users on their browsers in real time is great for communicating details on live events or limited time offers,” says Jenny.\nAs for Ubisoft’s favorite feature, though they are yet to try it out, the Segment Creator takes pole position. “We offer a lot of varied game features and opportunities for our games that might not appeal to every player. Being able to create segments around site behavior can help make informed decisions on this, and a more personalized communication strategy will be our key moving forward.”\nA Tip for Push Notification Users\nFor Jenny, her first notification itself was successful, reporting high click rates and website engagement, with results that superseded their initial expectations. However, she has a suggestion for all those people who implement push notifications for their websites – try and test out a few notifications to your users to analyze the results before rolling out at scale.",

It showed that the bounce rate within the shopping cart was somewhat higher in the winning combination, but the overall increased click rate outtakes the bounce rate.\nIn the second phase, some whitespace was removed and the product name was moved above the box shots, which led to another 10% increase in clicks and the final increase in purchases settled at about 20%.\nTakeaways\nThe concrete test showed that a clear modern design improved sales. Trust building is important, especially in the sales process.\nAlso, AquaSoft found VWO to be quite valuable:\nIt was so incredibly easy to create the test (A/B split test in this case) that it takes nearly no time.

        "raw_contents": "About EZ Landlord Forms\nKevin Kiene, the founder, was a landlord back in 2005. Tired of the hassles he faced in creating the right lease, he launched the EzLandlordForms website. Since 2006, he and his team have helped more than half a million landlords manage their properties with great ease.\nEzLandlordForms provides forms for a range of leases – residential, vacation, company, subleases etc. They have hundreds of free lease forms in printable format.\nBrian, Vice President at EzLandlordForms, signed up for a VWO subscription to explore ways in which they could get more revenue from their online business. He set up and ran a number of tests on different elements of the website’s homepage.\nGoals\nThe primary objective of the test was to establish which version of the homepage was most effective in getting visitors to purchase the paid product. The test tracked 3 goals:\nRevenue per visitor\nPurchase conversion rate\nFree account signup conversion rate\nTests run\nOn the original homepage, the CTA button read “View Free Forms”. EZ Landlord Forms offered a lot of printable free forms on their website, so the CTA text was pretty clear. But the problem was that it wasn’t helping them get paid conversions and account sign-up was a micro-conversion for them.\nThis is how the original page looked:\nBrian said, “We were concerned the CTA was too indirect, and failed to push users to where they were most likely to convert.”\nThe hypothesis was that taking visitors directly to a paid goal from the CTA button would be more valuable (to the company) than if it took a step-by-step approach in which visitors were first shown the forms for “free” sign up and from there to the purchase CTA. To test this hypothesis, two variations of the homepage were created and pitted against the original homepage.\nThe first variation took visitors to the intermediate page, where they could sign-up for a free account and browse the free forms. This was the same same as the control, except that the CTA button text was changed to “Create Lease”. This, they believed was a more direct way to get visitors to buy state-specific leases than asking them to first browse through the free leases.\nThis is how the variation looked:\nIn the second variation, the CTA text still said “Create Lease”. However, it dropped the intermediate page (where visitors could browse free leases), taking visitors directly to the lease wizard.\nThe test was run for a duration of 2 weeks over 6000 visitors.\nResult: The second variation, in which the intermediate step of taking visitors to browse free forms was dropped, emerged as the winner. The number of people who purchased the paid version went up by 32.2%. Revenue per visitor also increased by 20.4%.\nConclusion\nSo what helped prove the admittedly counter-intuitive hypothesis?\nThe value proposition offered by the variation was different from what was articulated in the control. The CTA text on the control simply invited visitors to “view free forms”. Keep in mind that visitors were likely looking to get lease documents relevant to them; therefore, the CTA text on variation, which invited visitors to “Create Lease” was more in line with what visitors perceived as valuable to them.\nThe variation dropped an intermediate step of taking visitors through the free forms. This solved two problems:\nIt did not distract (or confuse) people who wanted to buy a state- or property-specific lease by just showing them free forms\nIt eliminated one step in the process towards the final purchase goal. This reduced friction resulted in a higher conversion rate.\nWhat worked for one company may not work for another. A/B tests sometimes disprove hypotheses that seem right based on gut. Here is a success story where adding the word “free” increased the button CTR for a company by 99.42%. That’s the power of A/B testing. Use it wisely!",

However, it’s always a good to practice to A/B test those changes nevertheless, as testing gives you important data to back the claims and also helps you avoid bad ideas that may have seemed good earlier (before you A/B tested them).\nSomething similar was done by buyakilt.com, which is an online Kilt and Scottish Highland Dress retailer since 2004. They used VWO to test the changes before implementing these.\nGoals\nThe Buyakilt.com website had lot of category pages, which further had around 4 subcategory pages; and they wanted to test if providing a product filter would help them increase conversions.\nTests run\nThe product filters are just so common these days on eCommerce websites that you might not even test this change before implementing. It has become a standard UI element on ecommerce websites, but the team behind BuyAKilt.com wanted to test before coming to any conclusion and rightly so.\nHere’s how their product category page looked earlier:\nControl\nThey implemented a product filter, which gave visitors an option to shop by kilt type and kilt pattern and so on.\nHere’s how the variation looked:\nVariation (with a product filter on the left sidebar and in the middle)\nConclusion\nThey were quite surprised to find the dramatic rise in revenues and other conversions. Overall, there was 76.1% increase in the revenue, 26% increase in conversions, and 19.76% increase in shopping cart visits.\nAdding a product filter is an obvious feature that many eCommerce stores may or may not have, but this A/B test demonstrated that it worked well for BuyAKilt.com.\nFergus Macdonald from buyakilt.com mentioned that VWO was very valuable in running the A/B test and collecting results easily and quickly.

The original success story won the Gold Award at WhichTestWon’s Online Testing Awards 2014.\nDjoser, a major Dutch travel agency, hired Traffic4u to optimize its website conversions.\nGoals: Increase Online Bookings\nThe Traffic4u team worked closely with Djoser to look for ways to increase the number of online bookings through Djoser’s website.\nTests run: Give users a greater sense of control over their decisions with a “take an option” CTA\nIn the original version (control), a text link with a call to action button Book now was placed next to the specific travel date. On the basis of data analysis and experience, the team concluded that making an actual booking was a significant step for users of Djoser. They hypothesized that giving users an option and greater flexibility to confirm their booking (rather than just either book or leave) might encourage more users to book.\nTo test the hypothesis, the team developed a variation that contained an extra link called Take an option. Clicking this link opened the same booking form and captured the same information, but tickets were not booked immediately. The new CTA allowed users to reserve spots on a tour, with the option to cancel within 72 hours, without incurring any charges. At the end of 72 hours, the reserved spot would automatically convert into a confirmed booking.\nThis option clearly communicated the relevant information through the booking form and the confirmation email. Prospective customers could cancel their reservations within 72 hours either by phone or email, without being charged anything.\nThe test was implemented on all travel details pages of Djoser.nl and focused on the travel data/price table. From this table, visitors continued to a booking form to book a specific trip.\nThis is what the variation with the Take an option CTA looked like:\nConclusion: 33% increase in bookings (including “take an option”)\nOver the test period of 7 weeks, the variation resulted in 33.1% increase in bookings. The result had a 99% confidence level and was thus statistically significant. Given that visitors could also cancel through phone or email, backend data on cancellations was considered. The limited number of cancellations did not significantly influence the test results.\nSo why did this option result in additional bookings?\nThe answer in short is that it gave visitors time to mull over their decision, without any financial risk/penalty. At the same time, they knew they had a secure reservation if they decided to go ahead. And because they had already provided personal details and preferences, visitors had (unconsciously) entered into a relationship with Djoser.\nThis test also underscores that even relatively minor changes to a website can lead to significant improvements in conversions. While not all tests will lead to a positive result, every test will lead to insights.\nBut as a business owner or marketing agency, it is important that testing opportunities be regularly identified so that optimization opportunities are not missed or delayed.\nThe advice for advertisers is to design a continuous conversion optimization process. This process must comprise the following steps:\nContinually evaluate the effectiveness of your website on the basis of website statistics as well as user feedback.\nCreate hypotheses and A/B tests on the basis of impact/effort ratio.\nBuild and conduct tests.\nDocument test results and then implement winning test variations.",

The broad revenue goal is broken down into three objectives:\nReducing cognitive load and increasing purchases\nImproving Average Order Value (AOV) \nIncreasing Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)\nObservations\nWith the aim to achieve an increase in revenue, Paltalk, in collaboration with VWO Services, made a few observations on their website:\nThe subscription page did not display all the options in one fold. It was difficult to compare the different subscription features across the available options. There was also no social proof on the page, and the main CTA did not stand out. \nPaltalk offers 8 different virtual credit packs and users were often unsure which pack they wanted to buy. Virtual credits can be used to send virtual gifts from one user to another within the Paltalk community.\nAfter looking into heatmaps and session recordings generated using VWO Insights, it was observed that users were not able to effectively view the different categories of Virtual Gifts (or VGifts). Even within a particular category, users had to scroll to the right to see all the different gift options available.\nTests run\nEach of the above observations was tackled through three different tests, each with a different objective:\nTest 1:\nSince the subscription page was a little difficult to process, the team set out to reduce cognitive load, with an aim to make the purchase process smoother. They hypothesized that displaying all the subscription offerings above the fold in a tabular format with features listed would ease the process of comparison. At the same time, adding a few customer testimonials would act as social proof. \nAn entirely new design was created and was tested against the existing design as an A/B test:\nThe A/B test ran for 53 days with all incoming traffic participating in the test. Traffic was split equally between the control and the variation. The variation won with a 6.74% increase in successful purchases. An associated revenue increase of more than USD 2000 was also registered. The variation is now live for all users.\nTake a free trial to see how A/B testing works.\n\nTest 2: \nThe objective for this test was to improve the Average Order Value (AOV) and hence overall revenue. With 8 different virtual credit packs being offered, users were often unsure which pack they wanted to buy.\n\nThey hypothesized that offering users an incentive would push them to choose a higher value pack. \nA variation was created in which, every time a user selected one credit pack, a pop-up would be shown asking if they would like to purchase a higher value pack to help them increase their savings. This is what the pop up variation looked like:\nThe variation was run against the control as an A/B test which ran for 40 days, with traffic being equally split between the control and variation (all incoming traffic participating in the test). The variation won with a revenue uplift of USD 3,900. The variation is now live for all users. \nTest 3:\nThe objective of this test was to increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Qualitative analysis showed that users were not able to effectively view the different categories of Virtual Gifts (or VGifts). \nThey hypothesized that creating a cleaner, distraction-free design would reduce cognitive load, thereby increasing conversion rates, and hence ARPU. \nA variation was created which had a drop-down of all the Vgift categories on the left-hand side of the screen; clicking on a category would display all Vgifts of that category. This change improved the visibility of different categories and also individual gifts within each category.\nThe A/B test ran for 30 days with traffic being equally split between the control and the variation, with entire traffic participating in the test. The variation won with an 11.32% jump in conversion rate and a staggering 57.32% increase in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), leading to a total revenue uplift of around USD 21,000. The variation is now live for all users.\nConclusion\nThe winning variations running on the website have made it more effective than before. The team is also more confident about the website’s performance since the changes have been made through testing, and the impact of each is better known. \nNeedless to say, having made a significant impact on the website experience, conversion rates, as well as revenue, the Paltalk team has a lot of faith in VWO Services. Their aim is to increase their testing velocity and be more data-driven, and for this, they intend to work closely with VWO Services.\nStart your free trial with VWO today.",

All participants had to do was to spend about half an hour for 5 days, working on tasks such as creating a business pitch, and pitching guest posts and interviews.\nTo attract participants to the program and get them to sign up, LKR launched a campaign. This was aimed at making people curious about the Creating Fame program. The original page where much-targeted traffic landed looked like this:\nThe team hypothesized that the original call-to-action button text was not punchy enough, and that making the CTA button text more specific and hard-hitting would improve sign-ups for the campaign. They created a Challenger version with the new call-to-action text that said Make Me Famous.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nAfter people enrolled for the 5-day challenge, they were redirected to an article that emphasized why it has become so important for small businesses to maintain a good online presence.\nThe A/B test was set up and run on the VWO platform. The goal tracked was the number of sign-ups.\nConclusion\nThe challenger beat the original by 8.39%, with a statistical confidence of 99%.\nBelow is the screenshot of the test report from VWO:\nHere is a comparison image showing the original CTA and the CTA in the variation.\nClearly, the changed CTA text had greater appeal and helped drive sign-ups. So what worked? The text in the Challenger was definitely more specific. The text Make Me Famous\nconveyed the value of the campaign more effectively than the original CTA button text did. The new CTA button text tells people how they will benefit if they sign-up for the program.\nWhat added to the appeal was the use of the word Me that made the CTA more personal. In fact, the use of the first person (I, me, my, and others) in call-to-action texts is considered a best practice.",

Bandwidth’s API platform allows SaaS platforms, applications, and communications professionals seamless access to voice, text messaging, and 911 emergency calling capabilities over their own nationwide network.\nBandwidth has been using the VWO Experience Optimization Platform for the past 2 years for all their A/B testing and conversion optimization needs. We got in touch with Kevin Hill, Sr. Manager, Web & Search Marketing at Bandwidth to learn about the brand’s recent experiments and learn how effective they were in terms of conversion uplift.\nGoals\nOf the many successful A/B test campaigns that Kevin and the team have run to date, their primary goal has been to improve the overall performance of their website and let data guide business decisions. Their latest campaign was no different.\nDiscussing the experiment, the team unveiled that while analyzing the performance of their SMS API page, they felt a need to change the page’s overall design aesthetics and make it more palatable to increase visit-to-lead conversion rate.\nObservations\nAlthough the conversion rate of the page was in sync with the rest of the website, VWO Insights’ heatmap and scrollmap capability indicated low page engagement and scroll percentage, respectively. The qualitative data highlighted that there was some room for improvement in terms of enhancing the overall user experience.\nTests run\nKevin and the team spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the performance of the page and its primary conversion-fetching page elements. They hypothesized that by improving the page’s above-the-fold experience, the information architecture, and the value proposition messaging, they would witness an overall uplift in the page’s conversion rate.\nThe Test\nBased on their hypothesis, the team designed a new and improved SMS API product page challenging the control. The changes made were:\nImproving the page’s hero image and supplementing it with crisp content\nAdding customer logos as social proofs\nCommunicating the brand value proposition in a better manner\nHere’s how the control and the variation looked:\nControl and Variation for A/B test on bandwidth.com\nThe primary metric tracked through the experiment was the visit-to-lead conversion rate. The experiment ran for about 60 days, and approximately 3500 visitors became a part of the test, with traffic split equally between the two versions. Kevin and the team saw that visitors much appreciated the variation experience over its counterpart, and hence, there was a sharp increase in the page’s visit-to-lead conversion rate. The variation won with a 12% jump in lead conversion rate over the control.\nVWO is a great tool for understanding our users and improving our site! It’s testing functionality is critical to our data-driven approach to web design and conversion optimization. A/B testing remains the gold standard for understanding how different web designs impact performance and VWO’s A/B testing tools are top-notch.\nKevin Hill\nSr. Manager, Web & Search Marketing\nConclusion\nNext steps \nBased on the results, Kevin and the team rolled out the new page design and have begun the process of migrating other product pages to the same template. They’re looking forward to applying these learnings to other pages to drive similar improvements in the visit-to-lead conversion rate across their site!\nTake a free trial today to know how A/B testing works.",

An exclusive importer and distributor of Bloc products in the country, Dachfenster also offers customized blinds for various window types.\nThe company hired ClickValue—an online digital marketing agency—to improve the conversion rate of its website. The agency used VWO tools to set up and run multiple tests.\nGoals\nThe objective was to increase the number of visitors to the Dachfenster Rollo website convert to customers by making a purchase.\nAs a first step to identifying what elements needed to change, ClickValue analyzed the website. The focus was on one of the most important pages of the website – where visitors were required to select the brand of the blind.\nTests run\nOn the original page, visitors had to click a downward arrow that opened a drop-down list. They could then select one of the available brands and proceed to the next page to choose other specifications such as size, material, and type of blind they were looking for.\nThis is how it looked:\nTo push more people into the conversion funnel from this page, ClickValue decided to test it against 2 variations.\nIn the first variation, the drop-down list was replaced with the names of all brands listed in orange color. This was done with the objective of eliminating the need for visitors to click the drop-down list to find what brands are available.\nThis is how the variation looked:\nIn the second variation, each brand name was a separate button in green color, with the buttons organized to look like a list. This is how it looked:\nThe test was performed for close to 2,000 visitors over 50 days. The goal being tracked was the final purchase, that is, conversion of visitors into customers.\nConclusion\nBoth the variations performed better than the original.\nThe first variation increased the conversion rate by 18.1%, but the confidence level was a low 86%.\nAfter 53 days of testing, the second variation emerged as a statistically significant winner, increasing conversions by 33.4%.\nGood design is the key to optimization. In this case, making the information visually easy to consume made all the difference in the conversion rate. By making all the information available to visitors upfront, the number of steps needed for users to reach the conversion goal were reduced.\nIn the first variation, all available brands were shown upfront, thus eliminating a click. The second variation was able to optimize the purchase process further by clearly showing all available brands in the form of clickable buttons.",

        "raw_contents": "About Meddelandelån Sverige AB\nMeddelandelån Sverige AB is a Swedish company that offers online loans to consumers. The company uses the VWO platform for its website optimization tests.\n  Goals\nThe goal of this test campaign was to boost conversions from Meddelandelån’s home page.\nTests run\nThe company’s business depended on online users who applied for a loan through the website. To apply for a loan, visitors had to follow a simple 3-step process by using the widget on the home page:\nStep 1: Select the loan amount and time frame.\nStep 2: Identity verification by using a PIN code, bank account, or online identification.\nStep 3: Submission of personal information such as contact details, monthly income, and other fields.\nIf the applicant fulfilled certain credit check criteria, the loan would be granted and the money transferred to the applicant’s bank account.\nDespite the simple process and the Meddelandelån Sverige home page slider inviting prospects to Borrow 500 Kr for free as a new customer, the carousel was not getting any click-throughs.\nThe image slider on the original home page looked like this:\nSampsa Vainio from Meddelandelån’s online marketing team was the person responsible for driving conversions. To figure out why conversion rates were low, he first set up a conversion tracking test on the home page to analyze how visitors behaved on the website.\nHaving read about the potential perils of using an image slider on a website, Sampsa suspected that the image slider might be the reason why visitors get distracted and bounce. He hypothesized that replacing the slider with an impactful headline would cause more visitors to use the widget to apply for a loan. In turn, this would increase their website conversion rate.\nTo test this hypothesis, he used VWO to set up and run an A/B test on the home page image slider. A variation was developed with a headline that emphasized their value proposition:\nSmall Internet Loans\nBorrow money 7 days a week with clear pricing and honest terms\nTo add credibility, a brief text was also added mentioning the company’s presence in the industry since 2005 and with thousands of happy customers. The headline and text replaced the slider.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nThe variant was pitted against the original page. The goals tracked by using VWO were loan value per visitor and overall conversion rate.\nConclusion\nThe variation delivered a 5% increase in both overall website conversion rates as well as the loan value per visitor. This translated to an annual increase of US$90,000 without any additional advertising.\nThe image slider (or carousel) hurt conversions for several reasons:\nThey are a usability catastrophe because they take away control from visitors, who are left with an annoying browsing experience.\nThey increase the page load time. And every single second of delay in the load time can reduce conversions by 7%.\nMany studies have shown that as little as 1% of total visitors interact with the slider.\nPeople often ignore them. An NN group study mentioned that “The user’s target was at the top of the page in 98-point font. But she failed to find it because the panel auto-rotated instead of staying still.”\nThey push down the content of the page, which might harm your SEO (and hence search traffic). Note that sliders usually occupy the most important real estate on a website and this can be utilized to better effect.\nBy offering umpteen choices, they cause action paralysis in visitors, thus hurting conversions.\nIf there’s an image slider on your home page and you are looking at what to change, here are some possible options:\nCreate impactful headlines.\nUse the static image of a trending/profitable category.\nUse each slide as a static image to target different visitor segments.\nCustomize static offers for repeat visitors based on their behavior on the site. For example, if a visitor spends the most time on a certain product, the next time s/he visits, show an enticing image of the same product on the home page (instead of showing a carousel). You can easily implement this with VWO’s behavioral targeting feature.",

But as a prelude to boosting conversions, Medienreich wanted to increase engagement with company offerings on the website.\nTests run\nOn its home page, Medienreich showcased its training services under 3 broad categories:\nOpen training: Training participants from different companies.\nIndividual in-house training: Customized training for employees of one company conducted at the company’s premises.\nIndividual company training: These are also tailored to the client’s needs but held at Medienreich’s own training centers.\nThis is how the original home page looked:\nMedienreich’s online marketing team decided to replace the 3 broad training categories with 8 best-selling courses such as Photoshop, InDesign, AutoCAD, Excel, PowerPoint, Project, and others.\nBefore implementing the change on a permanent basis, MedienReich used VWO to run a Split URL test. Tracking “engagement” was the primary goal of the test.\nThis was the variation used:\nMedienreich ran the test for around 20 days.\nConclusion\nThe variation displaying the 8 most popular courses beat the control, increasing engagement by 40.87%. The statistical significance was 99.9%, which meant that the variation could be expected to beat the original 999 times out of 1000.\nMarc Stenzel, Medienreich’s SEM manager, estimated that as a result of the change, the year-on-year value of the home page increased by a phenomenal 106.42% (from $2,149.72 to $4,436.41).\nMarc Stenzel said, “My hypothesis was that we could decrease the bounce rate when we display our bestselling training topics as it would reduce the effort the visitor has to put into looking for them. I was happy to see that the hypothesis was true.”\nSo what are the key takeaways from the results of this test?\n1) Provide Right Information in Right Order\nYour website is like a story. Like all well-written stories, your website must convey facts in a logical sequence for them to make sense to visitors. In this case, that meant making it easy for visitors to find out easily if Medienreich offered the kind of training they were looking for. Only if it did would it make sense for visitors move forward to figure out if individual or in-house company training made more sense.\nAs Marc explained, “It is crucial when in the conversion funnel you provide which information. The visitors wanted to know if we provide training for their desired topic in the first place. The information about the different training types (as seen in the control) is information the customer is interested in after getting to know whether we provide their topic. So, the right information at the right time is important.”\n2) Think from the User’s Perspective\nIdentify your buyer personas and then put yourself in their shoes to understand what they are looking for and how they might approach their search on your website. As Marc put it, “To create the test, I was trying to think more like the user and how I could make it easier to find what he was probably looking for.”\n3) Display Your Best on the Home Page\nYour home page should contain information that is useful and relevant to visitors and easy for them to find. Avoid cluttering the home page with what is important to you (but not to potential visitors). Remember that your home page is the entrance to your store, so you must make it attractive for prospects to step in. You may find these tips on how to make your home page a conversion magnet handy.",

Under the brands Easycredit, Credigo, and Credway, the company serves more than 120,000 customers. Northmill’s Easycredit line of business provides payday loans between SEK 500–20,000 to customers with a history of payment default and who found it difficult to obtain credit elsewhere.\nSargon Kurt, cofounder of Northmill, realized the importance of converting website traffic to customers in a world that was going more online. He was keen to measure the ROI on online marketing and had started using tracking codes.\nIf there is a marketing manager out there who does not integrate VWO into their marketing function, I’d say they are lacking skills or not working with modern marketing.\nSargon Kurt\nCo-founder\nAfter calculated evaluation of all available options, Northmill selected VWO based on its interface and service. VWO enabled Northmill to test website pages in a controlled manner before making them live.\nGoals\nNorthmill’s offline marketing happened through national broadcasting, radio, print, and even some airline companies. Online channels were primarily Facebook, affiliates, ads and of course, SEO.\nNorthmill wanted to optimize the PayDay Loan application and increase conversions.\nTests run\nSargon strengthened the marketing team, assigning 2 people the task of A/B testing and conversion optimization.\nBack in the old days, we used to do what we thought was good in our minds. Look at things and decide on what to do. But the facts and reality can be entirely different. With softwares like VWO you can actually get the hard facts that users themselves provide.\nSargon Kurt\nCo-founder\nEasyCredit used both offline and online channels for marketing its services. This is what the EasyCredit Payday Loans’ original page looked like:\nA colleague asked Sargon “Do you think the side form is good?”\nSargon: “Yes, customers like it”.\nColleague: “What if we minimize the form and condense it behind a CTA?”\nThe hypotheses was that collapsing the application form would reduce the cognitive load on visitors, allowing them to explore EasyCredit’s offerings before deciding whether they wanted to fill the form or not. The idea behind this hypothesis was that it would retain more visitors on the page and lead to more applications getting filled. This is what the variation looked like:\nOn the variation page, the form could be accessed by clicking the Apply button in green in the upper-right corner.\nConclusion\nThe test was run for about 5 months, and the variation won with 7% higher conversions. And with VWO, the optimization process was made easier and more accurate.\nI’ve been working with VWO for over a year, and one of the reasons I love the software is because it’s user friendly and very intuitive. Of course, there are things we don’t always understand at first; but with the state-of-the-art support that VWO offers, we get all the answers and help we need. VWO has really succeeded in converting something that can be really complex into something fun and easy.\nSargon Kurt\nCo-founder",

        "raw_contents": "About Compare Courses\nCompare Courses is like a search engine for educational courses in Australia. An exhaustive database of more than 50,000 courses offered by 150+ public and private institutions makes it easy for prospective students to choose what is most appropriate to achieve their career goals.\nThe company uses VWO to test optimization possibilities on its website.\nGoals: Increase Leads Generated\nThe Compare Courses website had 3 CTAs that generated leads:\nSend Enquiry form\nAsk an Expert column\nRequest Brochure button\nThe main focus was to improve the overall conversion rate of the website.\nTests run: Redesigning CTA Elements\nGiven the popularity of courses leading to a Bachelors of Accounting degree, the company decided to optimize the landing page for this course, which originally looked like this:\nAll 3 CTAs aimed at lead generation are clearly seen in the above image. While all 3 CTAs were equally important, the Compare Courses team wanted to test its hypothesis that conversion rate would increase by making changes to the lead enquiry form. They decided to redesign the Send Enquiry form.\nThis was the variation page they created:\nAs the variation page required significant code changes, Compare Courses ran a Split URL test that tracked all 3 lead generation routes for the variation page. The test was run using the VWO platform.\nTo make the page look better, the new Send Enquiry form was placed on the right so as to improve symmetry. Its placement was above the fold, and a testimonial was displayed next to it to provide social proof and enhance credibility.\nThe placement of the Ask an Expert form was also shifted to support the design symmetry of the page. It now appeared where the Send enquiry form appeared on the Control Page. The placement and design of the Request a Brochure CTA button remained unchanged in both versions.\nConclusion: Lead Generation Increased on Pages with No Changes\nIn the world of A/B testing, optimization teams propose, but it is visitors who dispose. The results of the above a/b test were quite unexpected:\nThe Lead generation rate from Ask an Expert CTA on the page increased by 159.52% with statistical confidence of 99.99%.\nThe Request Brochure CTA recorded a 13.3% improvement in the lead generation rate with 99.99% chance to beat the original.\nWhile the above results were positive, it must be remembered that no changes were made to these 2 CTAs except for the new placement of the Ask an Expert form to maintain design aesthetics of the web page.\nOn the other hand, considering the changes made to the Send Enquiry form, its placement above the fold and the addition of social proof, it was expected that lead generation would increase.\nHowever, the tests showed that the variation performed much worse than the original, recording a 53.87% decrease in the lead generation rate. The original version of the page converted leads at 9.71% while the variation converted at 9.52%. Given the large number of visitors to the page, this drop meant a loss of 100+ leads from the variation.\nHere’s the comparison image of the original version and the variation that were tested and the changes made:\nThe results of this test make it clear that when it comes to optimizing website conversions, one must never take anything at face value or go by what “feels” or “sounds” right. Even the most widely accepted “best practices” can belie expectations when applied without careful thought (and testing) to a website. Therefore, never make any changes permanent without having first tested them.\nAnother interesting takeaway from this test was that when there are more than one CTA on a page, it’s always best to track all of these during the test, even if changes have not been made to all of these.",

        "raw_contents": "About LKR Social Media\nFor a long time now, A/B testing experts and consultants the world over have been advising their clients to go for quick wins on a landing page. When we talk of quick wins, nothing is quicker than changing the headline copy.\nUnfortunately, in larger organizations, it’s also the one that causes a lot of heartburn because marketing and branding executives are uncomfortable positioning their offerings in the completely new ways suggested by optimization experts. Today’s success story shows why it makes sense to be continually testing and getting quick wins.\nLaura Roeder Social Media (now MeetEdgar) provides social media marketing training for small businesses based out of Los Angeles. Their online shops include Zero to Facebook, Your Backstage Pass to Twitter, and Creating Fame.\nGoals\nFor years, they had been using the headline “Could You Use a Free Plan For Promoting With Social Media?” on their home page, directing visitors to sign up for their newsletter “The Dash.”\nFor the headline test, Laura wanted to test something that was more conversation and sounded less like marketing copy.\nTests run\nLaura wasn’t sure if her idea would work because the new headline just refers to a newsletter, but not what it was about. That meant visitors wouldn’t be able to tell what they were signing up for.\nHowever, she let her intuitions be and turned to VWO to A/B test her idea.\nThis is how the original version, or Control, appeared:\nOld headline “Could You Use a Free Plan For Promoting With Social Media?”\nThis is how the variation appeared.\nNew headline “Yours is the only newsletter that I actually read.”\nConclusion\nEven though the variation headline was a winner from the word go, she let the test run for 12 days.\nAfter that period, reports showed that the variation headline increased signups for the newsletter by 24.31% with 97% chance to beat original.\nThe main takeaway in my opinion is to do something a little different that gets attention. We all know that visitors have a VERY short attention span, but we get so focused on mimicking what competitors do that our sites end up reading like boring brochures. Also, there’s no better source of feedback than real customers! That’s where I got the idea for the headline in the first place, it’s a piece of feedback that we get constantly.\nLaura Roeder\nCEO\nThe best part is that Laura didn’t stop at that. In fact, she’s almost always testing and the current landing page of the website has undergone many changes. It employs loads of best practices and is an excellent guide for anyone interested in optimizing their landing pages.\nQuickly rounding up the best practices on this home page, they are:\n1. A headline that catches the visitor’s attention\n2. A sub headline that provides social proof as well as a call to action to sign up for their newsletter\n3. Another call to action that includes an all caps “Free.”\n4. Large button that is easy to click and also has a contracted arrow pointing toward it.\n5. A large amount of social proof…see how social proof helped in increasing revenues by €50,000.\n6. Eyes looking toward the primary headline. Here’s some awesome research on how this affects visitor behavior.\n7. Human photos have shown to increase conversions even when intuition says they shouldn’t have.",

It is one among their several lifestyle products that cater specifically to women. Freeflys curates free samples and deals from sought-after brands across diverse categories like beauty, food, and toys.\nGoals\nAlex was exploring how he could enable notifications for his website.\nHe stumbled upon VWO Engage while browsing ProductHunt. He was delighted to see a service provider already delivering what he was trying to build. Instead of investing time and resources in reinventing the wheel, he decided to give the ready-to-use VWO Engage a try.\nTests run\nAs the next step, Alex signed up for a free account and added the VWO Smartcode to his website. In less than 3 minutes, push notifications from Freeflys were up and running.\nA notification went out from Freeflys as soon as a new sample was on offer. Unlike email, push notifications do not require smart subject lines to get more opens and engaging content for achieving great number of click-throughs. They just write a two-line message informing their subscribers about the product that’s on offer. Direct, simple, and easy to understand!\nWhen it came to time-sensitive deals, push notifications were much faster and effective in communicating them than emails which had a risk of going unread before the deals were exhausted.\nThe average click rate from the first 20 notifications they sent out is 12.55%. Freeflys built a list of 4,400 subscribers in just 30 days of installation of VWO Engage. Have a look at the notification that worked best for them so far:\nConclusion\nAlex is thrilled to see Freeflys’ subscriber list growing. “Push notifications fill a role that no other marketing channel can, when it comes to instant communication with our community. This is definitely a medium to watch out for,” he remarks.\nAccording to Alex:\n“Push notifications fill a role that no other channel of communication can. And with VWO Engage, Freeflys could set up its push notifications in less than 3 minutes!“",

        "raw_contents": "About Leadpages\nClay Collins is the founder of Leadpages, one of the most versatile landing page building tools available today. In an insightful interview with Mixergy, he narrates how he used to give away free templates of landing pages from his blog.\nInitially, he used to spend days working on and publishing intense thought pieces on the site. Then one day, he came across Gary Vaynerchuk- entrepreneur and internet personality. Gary would post videos of impromptu wine reviews and garner millions of views just like that. This was miles ahead of the handful of comments Clay would receive on his carefully crafted blog posts.\nSoon, Clay adopted the video format and he found more takers for what he was offering. He talked about ‘how the template worked, why it worked and instances where people would want to use it and then gave it away’. This, among other things, eventually lead to the founding of Leadpages.\nToday, Leadpages is one of the top startups in Minnesota. They’ve built tools that create launch pages, sales pages, and other conversion pages that enable businesses to grow a devoted audience. Since 2013, they’ve raised $38M in three rounds of funding.\nRecently, Leadpages acquired Drip- the much talked-about email automation tool that has been holding its own against the heavyweights of marketing automation.\nGoals\nJason Martin joined Leadpages in 2014 when the company had under 50 employees. Jason, as Marketing Project Manager, works on optimising the back-end processes and automation of marketing operations on a daily basis. He also works closely with the publishing and promotion of the Leadpages Blog. To make his job easier, he is always on the lookout for tools that optimize traffic and conversions on the Leadpages website and blog.\nJason came across web push notifications from VWO Engage on the website of ConversionXL. The fact that VWO Engage was built by the makers of VWO, one of the easiest A/B testing tools available to marketers, prompted Jason to give it a try. Leadpages signed up for VWO Engage in April 2016 and has been using it ever since.\nVWO Engage Opt-In on the Leadpages Blog\nTests run\nDaphne, the copywriter at Leadpages, writes compelling and targeted copy for each notification that goes out. The destination of push notifications sent from Leadpages is a mix of landing pages and blog posts.\nJason was thrilled to see their push notifications getting an average click-through rate of 18%. Although emails are a completely different medium with its own merits, he couldn’t help but observe that push notifications delivered 3X response as that of email. The best CTR they’ve received so far is a huge 25%.\nUsers visiting the website through push notifications spent an average session time of 2.5 minutes. The bounce rate is as low as 40%.\nOver 6,000 subscribers of the Leadpages blog are now subscribers of their web push notifications. “Over 500 email-opt ins can be attributed to VWO Engage. Our data shows that a VWO Engage subscriber is likely to share our destination page, and that referral will convert to a lead,” Jason added.\nThe notifications that drive instant bursts of traffic are promotional notifications on limited or time-bound offers. Offers like ‘Last day to avail extra template’ send the CTR shooting through the roof.\nConclusion\nCurrently, Leadpages sends notifications at a frequency of two or three a week. Jason plans to increase the frequency once the segmentation feature is in place. Next, they plan to send specific notifications to special segments created based on marketing campaigns.\nThe Drip blog has also started sending push notifications by using VWO Engage. They are enjoying growth in opt-in rates similar to that of Leadpages.\nPushCrew Opt-In on the Drip Blog\nJason is happy with the numbers. However, he observes that certain standards and best practices should be in place for push notifications. Even though it is a permission-based medium, marketers can bombard their subscribers with notifications if they don’t follow these. Users should be made aware of the unsubscription process as well.\nWhen asked how his experience with VWO Engage has been so far, Jason says, “VWO Engage is a great way to interact with your audience in a timely manner and see immediate results. Its user retention and reengagement capabilities are strong.”",

        "raw_contents": "About Visit Norway\nVisitNorway.org, one of our customers, published their experiences using VWO tools for A/B testing and the outcomes in their original blog post, which was in Norwegian. This success story draws upon that blog.\nVisitNorway uses VWO tools to run A/B tests to quickly and effectively measure the expected impact of changes to text, images, design, and functionality on its website.\nGoals: Improve Website Design and Functionality to Make These Better for Users\nAs part of its efforts to improve visitnorway.com, Visit Norway’s team uses analytics and usability tests runs and surveys to assess the needs of its visitors and accordingly customize the site for content, look and feel, functionality, and other features.\nThe team started using VWO, an easy-to-use A/B testing tool that quickly and effectively helped measure the impact of various changes the team wanted to make on the site based on input from users, experts, and other optimization hypotheses.\nWhen it was decided to conduct a test, the necessary variation was made and the test was set up on VWO. Performance of the variation was compared against the original for defined goals (such as click-throughs, CTA clicks, conversions, and others).\nThe test results and the associated confidence levels helped the team decide whether or not to implement the variation permanently on the Vistnorway.com website.\nTests run: A/B Testing Ensures Objective Resource Utilization by Providing Objective Data for Proper Decision-Making\nHere are the results from some of the tests VisitNorway conducted:\n1) Click to destination company websites from landing pages\nWe wanted to find out about simple design change on landing pages to increase the number of clicks to the destination’s websites. At first, we only increased the size of the link text and converted it into bold.\nThe test was done on VisitOSLO pages of visitnorway.com. We got a positive increase of 70–75% in the CTR by changing the size and using bolder font, as may be seen from the screenshot below.\nWe, therefore, proceeded with this change on the landing page and increased visits to the destination company website.\n2) What should “Booking” be called in the top menu?\nWe tested different names for the menu item “Booking” in English, Norwegian, and Spanish, hoping to lead even more of those who were interested in booking a holiday to the booking section.\nFor English, the text Booking won with an improvement of 39% against Book Online, as it originally stood.\nOnline booking had a 14% improvement to the original.\nThe Norwegian word for Order with an improvement of 114% (!) won against the original Book travel.\nSee the screenshot below for an overview of the other variants.\nIn the Spanish menu, we wanted to see if it was better to write Booking in Spanish or English. Since Book Norway site did not have a Spanish version, we were curious about the bounce rate.\nWith regard to how many people went to booking section, Booking had a decrease of 48% in English (Variation 1) in relation to Reservas (Control).\nSee the screenshot below.\nThe bounce rate was similar for both, so we eventually chose Reserve in the Spanish version.\nBased on the above results, we changed the text in the menu to the “winners” of the three tests.\n3) Moving the Order link in the main menu for the Norwegian edition\nWe wanted to see how much change there was in the number of clicks to the Book Norway CTA when we moved the Order from the second position to the second last and last position in the main menu.\nWe noted a decline of 72–73% in the number of clicks, as may be seen from the screenshot below.\nBased on the data, we did not move the Order CTA link.\nConclusion: A/B testing provides objective data to back up decisions around what website elements to change to achieve sustainably optimal results\nTo quote VisitNorway:\n“A/B testing is an important method for us to determine whether it is wise to move forward with new concepts or changes, before we spend a lot of time and money on design and development. We will use it actively to get real decision-making data. Our findings show that one must be careful of what you call “booking” in various languages- words are tremendously powerful”.\n“We chose VWO because it was easy to use and had enough functionality to allow us to carry out the tests that we wanted”.",

        "raw_contents": "About Server Density\nServer Density provides hosted server and website monitoring services. By monitoring websites from locations around the world and combining internal server metrics, they tell clients when their websites are down and why.\nDavid from Server Density wanted to try whether increasing prices increased overall revenues. He chose VWO, the world’s easiest A/B testing software, to set up and run a test.\nGoals\nThe revenue can be increased either by increasing prices and/or getting more paying customers. The ideal situation would of course be more customers paying a higher price. But as David and his team were contemplating options, they had to grapple with 2 competing hypotheses:\nIncreasing prices would reduce free sign-ups.\nOR\nIncreasing price would increase revenue in spite of reduced sign-ups.\nThey decided to A/B test to find out which was the more likely outcome. To run these tests, they used VWO.\nTests run\nThe test was set up with 2 goals:\nFree-trial sign-ups (Goal 1)\nUpgrade (Goal 2)\nGoal 1 was considered to be achieved when visitors signed up for a free trial, and Goal 2 when they upgraded to a paid account.\nServer Density’s initial pricing page looked like this:\nThe control was configurable pricing where customers paid based on the number of servers and websites they wanted to be monitored. The assumption was that there is a direct correlation between the number of entities monitored and value provided.\nAlthough the majority of Server Density customers had 7 servers, they chose this pricing structure to cater to first-time, single-server users in the hope of increasing their customer base.\nNotwithstanding the fact that most of the customers of Server Density complained about their prices, they decided to A/B test a new “packaged” pricing structure where the lowest package started from US$99 per month. Here’s the variation screenshot:\nUnder the old plan, the price for monitoring 10 servers and 10 websites would have been US$130 per month, whereas under the new plan, the price for 10 monitoring servers and 10 websites would be US$99.\nSo the company dropped prices but increased the average order value (AOV).\nConclusion\nThe results were interesting. Although the number of free sign-ups dropped by 24.96%, the total revenue increased by 114%.\nThe test results are summarized below:\nGoal 1: Free sign-up\nControl (per unit pricing): 1,950 visitors, 135 conversions, 6.92% conversion rate\nVariation (packaged pricing): 1,925 visitors, 100 conversions, 5.19% conversion rate\nGoal 2: Paid upgrade\nControl (per unit pricing): 1,950 visitors, 20 conversions, US$19.70 AOV, total revenue US$394\nVariation (packaged pricing): 1,925 visitors, 15 conversions, $55.53 AOV, total revenue $833\nA/B testing is a powerful technique not only because it is objective but also because it allows us to gather key insights about customer behavior.\nIt is important to get pricing right and the best way to do so is to test hypotheses with real data. Most customers care more about the value they derive rather than how much it costs you to provide your service. Therefore, base your prices on what your product/service is worth to your customers and not on how much it costs you or the profit you want to make per sale.\ndavid mytton\nCEO\nCustomer preferences change, as do competitor actions. Therefore, always be testing, so you don’t leave money on the table (think pricing packages, pricing displays, promotional offers etc.)",

She decided to redo the navigation bar on their home page by tweaking certain tabs, eliminating some and adding new tabs.\nThis is how the website originally looked:\nTests run: Improve engagement through better CTA text and reduced distractions\nThere were 10 tabs on the original home page. This, Korin felt, was too high a number and would distract visitors. To get more people to buy, it was essential that more visitors engaged with the website by clicking the tabs, getting to know what services they offered and how these were different.\nKorin hypothesized that making the following changes to the navigation bar would help:\nRename the “Compare” tab to “Compare Prices.”\nRename “Get Started Now” to “Form a Company Now.”\nAdd a new tab titled “How to Incorporate” (this was present as a link in the left pane of the original home page).\nRemove the tabs “Blog,” “About Us,” and “Contact Us.”\nHere’s how the variation looked:\nThe A/B test pitting the variation against the original (control) was run on the VWO platform on almost 32,000 visitors. The goals tracked were actual sales (completed orders) and visits to the “Compare Price” and “How to Incorporate” pages.\nConclusion: 15.68% increase in the orders completed (sales)\nThe variation emerged as a winner, recording a 15.68% increase in the total orders completed. The variation did well in terms of the secondary goals as well: visits to the “compare prices” page and “How to Incorporate” page increased by 66.26% and 382.45% respectively.\nBuoyed by the success of the test, Korin continued to use VWO to regularly test further improvements to the website.\nIt is useful to look at how and why the changes drove engagement and sales:\nRenaming the “Compare” tab to “Compare Prices” made the CTA absolutely directed. The word “Compare” by itself didn’t give users a clear understanding of what they would see if they click the tab. This was an important change, as it quickly conveyed to visitors the cost savings offered by Harvard Business Services.\nExplaining the importance of this change, Korin, who set up and ran this A/B test said: “This (visits to the comparison page) is especially important for us because we work in a competitive industry and our prices are an obvious way that we stand out from the competition. We’re thrilled that this small change has enticed visitors on our site to click through to a page that compares us with the competition, so that they can be more confident of their purchase.”\nChanging “Get Started Now” to “Form a Company” resonated with visitors by articulating for them what they were looking to do. The new CTA text guided visitors and gave them a sense of confidence that they were indeed getting started on what they had come for.\nThe new tab “How to Incorporate,” which was originally present as a link, got them an astounding 382% more visits to the page. Website analytics revealed that many visitors moved directly from this page to the final purchase. This proved that prospects wanted to be educated about the process of business formation before they decided to buy the incorporation service.",

        "raw_contents": "About Kutts\nEstablished in 2010, Kutts have stuck to their guns in their mission of providing the best grooming products for men to both professionals and individuals across Sweden. Particularly in the pandemic era, when grooming and self-care became something of a personal necessity for all, Kutts made sure that they were able to provide utmost value for all the users. Keeping that in mind, Kutts reached out to VWO to improve their website’s customer experience.\nGoals\nPhilip Lindqvist, the main architect behind Kutts.se was looking for an A/B testing platform that could help them increase their sales by doing experiments and finding loopholes across their website. The core business objective for him was to improve conversions for their eCommerce business from different online mediums.\nObservations\nThe challenges that Philip saw for the brand were three-fold:\nAdvanced testing with minimal effort: Kutts was in dire need of a platform that would let them run advanced tests without the usual impediments like dev support and extensive coding. \nHands-on help: Philip wanted not just a platform but was also on the lookout for a team that could handhold the Kutts team in ideation and implementation. \nNeed for a connected platform: Philip was also sure of the fact that Kutts would benefit if the complete experimentation cycle took place in a single platform rather than follow a silo approach. He also wanted to track everything across a single platform.\nTests run\nBased on the three-fold challenges that the brand faced, Philip enlisted multiple platforms and finally narrowed down to VWO due to its combined conversion optimization capabilities and ease of use. \nWith VWO Services he was also able to get an expert team that could work as an extension of the Kutts team when it came to implementing and tracking test results/ business goals/ user analysis for the organization. VWO Services also simplified the result interpretation for the Kutts team by using Google Analytics (GA) data for the campaign results.\nWhile the overall VWO setup helped the Swedish brand reap the benefits of conversion optimization and build upon their own experimentation architecture, there were few standout tests that the Kutts team felt like highlighting.\nThe Tests\nTest 1 – Changes in the top categories of the listing pages | All Devices\n  Observation:  \nAcross all the listing pages on kutts.se, there was a high drop-off and not many users were clicking on the main categories in general. \nEven after scrolling through the main categories, the response to the product images was lukewarm, attracting no or very limited attention from the visitors.\n  Hypothesis: \nBased on the observations and analysis, the VWO Services team added a new call-out with pricing information to motivate website visitors to click on the categories. Along with this, the team made an informed choice of rejigging the image style and type across the categories.\nResult:\nBased on the website data, the variation created was able to not only improve the eCommerce conversion rate by nearly 6% and revenue by 9%, but was successful in moving in the needle with the quantum of transactions (9%) and average order size (0.5%) carted by visitors.\nStart your free trial today to optimize your web page for conversions.\nTest 2 – Links in the Checkout Page | All Devices\nObservation :\nThe team observed that there were a lot of nudging opportunities across the checkout page to sell more products. This was deduced from the insights that the team received by analyzing visitor behavior – many visitors clicked on the cart icon and the cart being empty. These visits were a barrage of latent opportunities to tap into as far as the core business goals (eCommerce conversion) for Kutts was concerned. \nHypothesis:\nBased on the observations, it was concluded that the checkout pages should have links to various product categories for quick reference of the visitors. Not only was it thought to be a nudging mechanism but it was hypothesized that it would also add to an improved user journey for the visitors.\nResults:\nThe website visitors were not only able to navigate through the CTA-based checkout page but also converted better than the earlier non-CTA-based checkout page. An upliftment of 10.45% in the number of people clicking on the checkout CTA was observed.\nConclusion\nIn around 9 months (which is still a formative period in conversion optimization parlance), VWO not only showcased the value of a connected platform and a guided experimentation program but was also able to proverbially, put their money where their mouth was.  A 6% improvement in conversion rate, in a time frame so stringent, is a testament to the power of A/B testing and user experience. Start your free trial today to experience this for your brand too!",

        "raw_contents": "About Bakker Hillegom\nBakker-Hillegom is an international mail order company that sells plants, flower bulbs and garden accessories through its website.\nA client of VWO, the company’s online marketing team uses the VWO platform for testing optimization opportunities for its website.\nGoals\nThe objective of the test was to increase the number of visitors clicking on the “Top Deals” section of Bakker Hillegom’s website’s information pages.\nObservations\nThe problem was clear: in spite of having a large number of visitors to its information pages, Bakker was not able to encash those visits.\nTests run\nApart from operating as an online web store, the website contained a huge repository of information on how people could take care of their gardens. According to Ben Vooren, the online marketer at Bakker, the website’s information pages attracted many new visitors every day because the content was unique and relevant. But although traffic to the website was high and visitors spent a considerable amount of time going through the content, the vast majority left without buying. As Ben said, “While we were hoping that the visitors would engage with the website and buy from us, they generally left after consuming the relevant information”.\nThis is what one of the information pages looked like:\nBen hypothesized that placing commercially-focused banners on top of all the information pages of the website would increase user engagement. But before actually implementing the change on the site, he wanted to check if this hypothesis would bring any positive results.\nFor this, he used VWO to quickly set up and run a pattern test on all the information pages of the website. The primary goal was to increase the number of people clicking on the “Top Deals” section of the website (which consequently increased site engagement). The test was run for 12 days on 8,000 visitors.\nThe challenger had just one major change in that two prominent banners were placed on the top. The first banner read “Top Deals” and it sent the visitors to Bakker’s top deals page where they could buy products at discounted rates. The second banner was for newsletter subscription. This is how the variation with the banners looked:\nResult: The challenger won hands down, recording a 104.99% increase in visits to the ‘Top Deals’ with a statistical significance of 99.99%.\nConclusion\nThe results inspired Ben to perform further tests to identify additional opportunities- for example, where the banners are placed on the information pages.\nAs always, it is useful to go behind the scenes to understand what may have caused the desired change in behaviour. Three possible reasons can be identified:\n1) Directing visitors towards a bargain\nOne reason why the ‘Top Deals’ page got so much attention is because it suggested incentives. Visitors were assured by the CTA text that they would be taken to a place where the “best deals” would be listed. This tempted them to click and explore. This is how incentives work.\n2) Prominent positioning of the banners\nThe banners were placed at the top of page and the ‘Top Deals’ message was on the right side. F-shaped reading pattern indicates that this position was effective in ensuring that visitors do not miss content placed there. This was a significant difference vis-a-vis the placement of the ‘Top Deals’ link on the original page, where it was buried as a category under a drop down menu. This meant that only visitors with resolute intent to buy would click on it.\n3) Clearly defined path of engagement\nThe phenomenon of visitors consuming relevant information and leaving without buying could be explained by the fact that the original page did not have any prominent call to action or navigation path. Adding the banners gave visitors an opportunity to engage further.",

They use VWO for conversion rate optimization.\nIn this success story for their customers, SlideShop.com, they apply a usability best practice and help them increase conversions.\nGoals\nOptimeria analyzed the browsing behavior of the visitors on the SlideShop website and saw that they weren’t as committed to staying within a category or subcategory. Heatmap and clickflow analysis of multiple key pages indicated that visitors did not sufficiently engage with the top menu – specifically subcategories. This let to the hypothesis that improving engagement will increase activity in the more focused subcategories.\nThe aim was to also improve usability on the site, and see how it affects clickflow patterns.\nTests run\nIn the original version of SlideShop.com, all pages had a promotional bar on the right which had special offers, customer testimonials, and so on.\nSee how the original version looked like:\nOriginal design of Slideshop.com\nThe goal of this A/B test was to increase user engagement (on-site), and also create a better flow from categories to subcategories and across main categories.\nOptimeria replaced the promotional right sidebar with a left navigation bar that did not have the heavy focus on single visual elements\nSee below how the variation with the left navigation menu bar looked like:\nNavigation Menu on the Left: 34% Increase in Add-to-Cart Clicks\nNote that all the subcategory pages are neatly displayed in the left navigation bar and it is much more intuitive to browse different pages on the eCommerce store.\nConclusion\nThe variation design for SlideShop saw an 8.9% lift in user engagement and a staggering 34% lift in visitors adding products to cart. Besides, a lot of key patterns emerged when looking at the new click-flow patterns.\nThey were impressed with the engagement lift, as SlideShop already had a good engagement rate, but they were surprised about the lift in adding to cart. (It was not expected – how adding a navigation bar could increase clicks on add-to-cart wasn’t clear.)\nWhen asked for the lessons learned, Karsten Lund, CEO, Optimeria said:\n“One should try to minimize browsing obstacles for visitors. Sometimes more clicks are better as long as they indicate a move forward in the conversion funnel. Better usability creates more motivated visitors.“\nHe also gives a lot of credit for that success to the tool used for testing, that is, VWO:\nWhat I like the most about VWO is the fact it saves me a lot of time in the actual execution of the test phase, so that I can focus a lot more on the hard analysis, thesis and reporting phase. My clients don’t necessarily see the difference, but they get much more learning value from me using VWO because I can focus on what I do best. Decision makers often like the fact they can get feasible results before they need to involve IT department in doing changes to the website.\nKarsten Lund\nCEO",

It was started by Chris and Ed in 2007 to build a community where people could share their knowledge of employers, interviews, and application processes. The purpose is to help people seeking employment be informed and shape their careers better.\nWikiJob has grown to be a profitable company, employing several staff, and proudly boasts many of the world’s largest brands as their clients. It now attracts over 500,000 visits a month.\n[This success story is based on a chat between Chris Muktar, Founder, WikiJob, and Paras Chopra, Founder, VWO.]\nGoals\nA previous test displayed the same testimonials further down the page and had no discernible impact on conversion. However, it’s commonly thought that social proof can help in the sales process, so we wanted to leave nothing to chance and test it.\nThere were 2 conversion goals. The first was the click-through to PayPal checkout. The other was to complete it and then buy something.\nTests run\nThe test was run on the page https://www.wikijob.co.uk/aptitude-tests. Most of the traffic was from the main https://www.WikiJob.co.uk website. The traffic to their website was almost entirely organic.\nWikiJob used VWO as A/B testing tool. They had tested a number of changes in the past and had some great results. This time they were testing the effect of 3 lines of testimonials from their customers and their impact on sales.\nBelow are the related screenshots.\nOriginal Page\nVariation (with screenshots): 34% Increase in Sales)\nTestimonials increased purchases by 34%. According to WikiJob, the testimonials they used were very ‘sober’ (compared with the overly enthusiastic ones often seen in marketing literature).\nConclusion\nAlthough such increases of sales can be quite normal in split URL testing, Chris did not think that testimonials would make such a difference (and indeed put off testing them, thinking they were irrelevant). The increase in revenue was substantial.\nLessons Learned\nSocial proof is important, and it is important to test everything. WikiJob may try putting some small pictures next to each testimonial to see if this improves things. To see how these tests works and gives social proof, start your free trial today. \nVWO has been invaluable. You pay for the service once, but the increase in profits and revenues continue into perpetuity. Through the use of several iterations of tests, we have increased sales threefolds.\nChris Muktar\nFounder",

They partnered with VWO in September 2020 to optimize their website experience and conversion rates. And with the immaculate results delivered by the VWO Services team, they hope to further this partnership.\nGoals\nScott and the optimization team at Bear Mattress were quite clear on the areas they wished to probe on the website. With the aim of increasing revenue, the focus was on optimizing the ‘Cross-sell Flow’ on the Mattress product detail pages of the website.\nObservations\nBased on the objectives defined, VWO Services team helped the Bear Mattress team streamline the scope of experimentation.\nBased on visitor behavior analysis using VWO Insights, it was observed that:\n There was negligible visitor interaction with the ‘Frequently bought with mattress’ section which consists of the cross-sell product listings.\nOverall clicks on cross-sell products were fewer compared to the other elements of the page as observed in the heatmap of product pages.\nImages weren’t present with items present in the ‘Frequently bought with mattress’ section of the page, which was impacting the engagement level of this page.\nFurther, the copy was not customer-centric but product-centric. It didn’t pique interest or give enough reasons to customers to consider buying the product. \nThese challenges had to be addressed immediately.\nTests run\n  Test – Redesign Cross-sell section of Mattress Product Page (Mobile)\nOwing to the several issues identified on the ‘Frequently bought with mattress’ section of mattress detail pages it was decided to redesign the section in its entirety and test the new version. VWO services made the following changes to the existing design, which became the variation:\n  A thumbnail image was added along with the items present in the cross-sell section.\nThe copy was changed, making it customer-centric. Questions such as ‘Why do I need a protector?’, and ‘Can I use my old box spring?’, were added\nInstead of showing Bear frame upfront as a 3rd option in the cross-sell section, it was made conditional by showing it only when users added foundation (since showing frame option made sense to users who were buying the foundation). \nAdditionally, a copy of the subheadline was added with Bear frame to increase engagement with this option.\nLastly, for users who didn’t want to buy more products, the ‘Mattress only’ option was added with a nudge for users to consider having a look at the cross-sell items such as protector and bed base foundation.\n  The team hypothesized that a new design with the above changes would increase engagement with the cross-sell section of ‘Frequently bought with mattress’ on mattress detail pages and increase revenue and Average order value.\nOlder Cross Sell Flow\nNew Cross Sell Flow\nResults\nThe A/B test ran for 19 days. All traffic visiting the mattress product detail pages on mobile participated in the test, with a 50-50 split between the control and the variation. \nThe performance of user behavior-related metrics saw an immense improvement based on the customer-centric nudge-based approach.\n  Below is a product-wise break up of the improvement in add-to-cart CTA:\n  Protector – Add to carts increased by 51.75% in variation\nFoundation – Add to carts increased by 73% in variation\nFrame –  Add to carts increased by 36.03% in variation\nOverall the variation outperformed the control with a 24.18% uplift in successful purchases and a 16.21% increase in revenue, (implying an estimated uplift in annual revenue of 23.22%).\nConclusion\nHaving a user-friendly interface in a niche industry like sports mattresses not only gives you avenues for up-sell and cross-sell but also makes the entire user journey more seamless for the customers. The team at Bear Mattress was able to leverage this and is gearing up to improve other aspects of their website.

        "raw_contents": "About Tiendeo\nIn founder Maria Martin’s words, Tiendeo was started in 2010 with nothing less than the lofty ambition of reinventing the ubiquitous print catalog. Print catalog, a staple of Western consumerism for decades now, was a relic of the mail age. It was headed for obsolescence, and it certainly would have, if Tiendeo hadn’t resurrected it in an avatar that the modern digital consumer understands.\nTiendeo took catalogs online and gave users access to the same coupons and offers that once made mail-order catalogues such a fun shopping experience. Adding geolocalization, online offers, and allowing marketers greater targeting, Tiendeo is well on its way to reinventing the print catalog. Today, Tiendeo is present in more than 31 countries, with more than 17 million users per month.\nGoals\nTiendeo wanted to get more of their newsletters read; they also wanted to use pushes for their now super-successful mobile app. And being an innovative company, they were always looking for the new, trending marketing channel, and hence made their way to push notifications.\nTests run\nWhen they started trialling VWO Engage, the thing that got them most excited was the idea that they could give new users a relatively easy way to come back to the website for new offers. There would be less friction than email and adding a new list of subscribers was an exciting prospect for them.\nWith VWO Engage, Tiendeo started to try a bunch of stuff. At first, they started to send links of client catalogues to users. This evolved after some time as they started to lead users to land on pages with exclusive offers and coupons and so on. The response excited them so much that they are experimenting with several different combinations to reach customers, and really enjoying what they are doing. Now, they can even quote focussed insights like the best time of the day to send out a notification.\nConclusion\nTiendeo has been using VWO Engage for more than a year now, and their numbers are remarkable. Their average click rate is at 23% while their all-time high is a phenomenal 33%.\nOne of the important things the team shared with us was that their pushes have 30% more engagement than their newsletters, which go to subscribers through email. Notifications on supermarket discounts, that most subscribers routinely look forward to, have turned out to be a hit. The percentage of returning visitors is now at 49%.\nWe asked what they loved about VWO Engage, and the Tiendeo answer was prompt. Claudia Correia from the Tiendeo team told us that VWO Engage was tremendously easy for them, as a non-tech team, to use, and that it made sure their messages and CTAs were delivered clearly, which is exactly what they required from a communication tool.\nAs for partnering with the team, she added that VWO’s professionalism and insight into their domain are adding value to the Tiendeo business.\n“As a non-tech team, using VWO Engage has been tremendously easy for us. Our messages and CTAs are delivered clearly.”\n-Claudia Correia, Content Manager at Tiendeo",

Each person has unique skin and hair and therefore the solution provided is highly customized.\nUltraviolet Digital, Kaya’s digital marketing agency observed that conversion rates from Kaya’s website were lower than the category average. They used VWO tools to perform A/B tests to validate improvement opportunities.\nGoals: Increase conversion (appointments booked) and walk-ins from the website\nKaya’s website was an important channel for prospects and customers to book appointments and attract walk-ins. Ultraviolet Digital realized that the landing page had not been adequately tested, and that there were various elements that could be improved. Gautam from the agency decided to run multiple tests to figure out what changes would help increase the effectiveness of Kaya’s landing page in driving conversions. He chose the VWO platform to run multiple tests.\nThis is what the original landing page looked like:\nControl\nTests run: An effectively optimized landing page is vital to create a good first impression that is a precursor to clickthroughs and conversion\nGautam and his team decided to test two hypotheses:\nRewording the Call To Action text just above the form would increase conversion rates and consequently, sales.\nSocial media integration would increase the form submit rate.\nThey created two variations and tested them against the control (original landing page) over a period of 45 days. The screenshots of the two variations are shown below.\nVariation 1\nVariation 2\nConclusion: 137.5% increase in conversion leading to 22% increase in sales with no incremental advertising\nBoth hypotheses were validated by the test results. Rewording the CTA text just above the form led to massive conversion increases that had a direct impact on the business bottom line. Specifically:\nConversion rate of Variation 1 was 137.5% better than Control (9.5% versus 4%)\nThe CTA text change led to a 22% increase in sales without a single additional dollar spent on advertising.\nAdding social integration (FB likes) further increased the conversion rate by 70%.\nSo what do these gratifying test results prove?\nThe first learning that is reinforced is that how the CTA is worded makes a difference. Phrasing it in a manner that clearly showcases the value of the service or benefit of the product to the user is vital. In this case, the phrase “Expert opinion” conveyed the value provided by Kaya’s experts more effectively than the generic “Skin consultation”. With VWO, you can easily test which CTA works best for you. Take a free trial to see how!\nThe second learning reinforced is the importance of “social proof” as a source of influence. Indeed this is one of the six keys that Dr. Robert Cialdini has written about. In this case, displaying the number of people who “Like” Kaya’s Facebook page is perceived by visitors as an indicator of social proof and this helps build trust towards Kaya in them.",

        "raw_contents": "About Arlington Plastics Machinery\nArlington Plastics Machinery is a seller of used plastic equipment and extruders. This company uses the VWO platform for website optimization.\nGoals\nThe goal was to increase sales leads by increasing the number of requests for quotes.\nTests run\nHere’s a screenshot of the original inventory page:\nBrian McKenzie from Arlington Plastics felt that the company’s inventory page listed almost 120 subcategories of plastics machinery. This was an overwhelmingly large number that made one of the most highly-trafficked pages hard to use. It was felt that this was one important reason for the relatively small number of leads the page generated.\n\nTo improve lead generation, the team began to dig deeper. Using Google Analytics and other tools, they uncovered valuable data insights about the page.\nThe team found that certain subcategories of equipment were vastly more popular than the rest. This led to the view that prominently displaying the most popular sub-categories in the inventory page would increase quote/information requests.\nAnalysis of internal site-search data revealed that far more people were searching for types of machines (e.g. “granulators”) rather than based on the purpose of machines (e.g. “size reduction”)- which is what was listed on the page. This led to the intent to test whether mirroring the language used by customers in their search would improve conversions.\nThe team also found that the original call-to-action on the page prompted prospects to call the company if they were unable to find on the website the plastic machinery they were looking for. But it was also found that besides requests for help in finding a particular machine, many people also called with questions around prices as well as around suitability of equipment. For example, “What type of extruder would work best for this project?”. This led to the view that a more open-ended phone call-to-action would increase leads compared to the original call-to-action that prompted people to call only if they needed help in finding a particular type of machinery on the website.\nClearly, several possibilities existed to improve lead generation by making changes to the inventory page.  \nBrian and his team decided to test the hypothesis that changing the introductory paragraph to address customers’ concerns better would generate more quote requests.\nThe following changes were made to the introductory paragraph using VWO’s WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) Editor\nAdded links to the 5 most popular subcategories in the opening paragraph.\nListed machine types rather than purposes (e.g. “single-screw extruders” rather than “Extrusion”).\nAdded the open-ended phone call-to-action.  \nThe table below shows a comparison of the original and changed introductory paragraphs:\nOriginal Introductory Paragraph Variation Introductory Paragraph\nArlington Plastics Machinery has a vast inventory of used and surplus plastics machinery. View our selection of plastics processing equipment, categorized by equipment type and function. Plastic equipment in stock includes: Blow Molding, Extrusion, Injection Molding, Support Equipment, Rotomolding, Size reduction, and Thermoforming. If you don’t see what you’re looking for, feel free to call and see if we can help find the plastic machine you need. Arlington Plastics Machinery has a vast inventory of used and surplus plastics machinery, including single-screw extruders, twin-screw extruders, horizontal injection molders, granulators, shredders, and more. Have any questions? Please call us at [phone number]!\nThe test was run using VWO. Here’s a comparison image of the 2 pages:\nConclusion\nThe Challenger page generated 150% higher leads than the original page, with 99.9% statistical confidence.\nAn additional $15,000 worth of sales queries were generated during the test. Assuming a constant conversion over the next 12 months, the new version was expected to deliver incremental annual sales of US$500,000.\nSo why did rewriting the introductory paragraph deliver such fantastic results?\nThe answer is ease of navigation and relevance of information. Even if visitors to your website are savvy and committed (such as procurement officers evaluating a $100,000 injection molder), they need to quickly find the information they are looking for, else they will bounce.\nThe changed page included prominent links to major categories in the introductory paragraph, making it easier for users to more easily find what they needed.",

        "raw_contents": "About Inside Buzz\nInside Buzz UK (now known as Target Jobs) provided graduates and young job-seekers curated information about top employers in different fields in the UK.\nThe company uses VWO’s Visual Editor for its website optimization requirements.\nGoals: Increase Engagement\nGiven the broad range of information and resources the site offered, the home page itself provided visitors with an overview of the entire site. This allowed them to get a sense of what the site offered, gauge relevance and decide how to engage further.\nEngagement for Inside Buzz meant visitors downloading free guides for the industry they were interested in, or reading unbiased company reviews written by other employees, getting the latest buzz around hiring processes and much more.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nAlthough the website did have a lot of useful information, the home page was cluttered. The existence of so many CTA options confused visitors, leading to a high bounce rate from the home page. Thus, rather than attracting visitors to engage more with the site, the original home page actually encouraged visitors to leave.\nThe team believed that decluttering the home page would increase engagement.\nTests run: Update Home page to Improve the Engagement Path for Visitors\nTo validate their hypothesis, they first conducted two tests using the VWO platform. The tests involved removing elements that were hypothesized as “unnecessary”. Buoyed by the positive test results, the team decided to overhaul the entire home page.\nFollowing the complete overhaul, this is how the Challenger page looked:\nUsing the VWO platform, the variation page was A/B tested against the original (control). The primary goal tracked was engagement, measured in terms of click-throughs to other pages on the website.\nHere’s the comparison image, showing the control and the variation:\nConclusion: 17.8% Increase in Engagement\nAs expected, the variation beat the control and saw a 17.8% improvement for the overall site engagement.\nWe believe that the significant improvement in engagement was the net result of several factors:\nSimple Design: Unnecessary links and elements were removed, which gave a good facelift to the website. Appearances definitely play their role in first impressions, and when it comes to site design, the Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS) approach is advised.\nAs Psychologist Barry Schwartz explains in The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less, a smaller number of choices speeds up decision making.\nRight Focus: Many first-time visitors to the original page probably felt lost. In contrast, the redesigned variation drew attention straight to the drop-down menu that allowed them to select the industry of interest and from there explore the site further. The focus of the site was to get visitors explore employer reviews and they found the right way to guide visitors to them.\nSingle Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: A single CTA right in the cener of the page made it harder for visitors to miss it.\nBetter Value Proposition: Typically, visitors assess the usefulness of a website in the first 8–10 seconds. The original page (the Control) was not successful in communicating the value of the site to visitors because of the clutter. Neither was the variation ideal in its ability to communicate the “What’s in it for me?” message to visitors. However,  the headline and the subheading right next to the drop-down in the center provided a decent context to what the site is all about.\nThe “Where do you want to work?” text right next to the drop-down box reduced ambiguity and provided clarity by guiding visitors to choose the industry they are interested in so that they could explore further what resources the website offered.",

Corcentric’s configurable, cloud-based SaaS solution uses advanced imaging technology and workflow management techniques to reduce the risk of outsourcing the Accounts Payable function and makes the process more efficient.\nThe company hired Greenlane Search Marketing to help optimize the conversions on Corcentric’s home page. VWO tools were used to set up and run the A/B test as part of the process to identify optimization opportunities.\nGoals\nThe company’s original home page clearly defined the value proposition offered by its solution. In addition, the home page had a bright yellow-colored CTA button that asked visitors to sign up for a demo.\nGoing by the Von Restorff effect, the yellow-colored CTA made the primary goal of the website stand out.\nTests run\nThis is how the original home page looked:\nGreenlane hypothesized that changing the CTA from Get a Demo to Free Demo would encourage more visitors to click the button.\nTo test the hypothesis, a variation was developed. This is what it looked like:\nUsing VWO tools, Greenlane ran the A/B test (variation against the control) for a period of 2 weeks, for close to 800 visitors.\nConclusion\nThe variation emerged as a clear winner, recording a 99.42% increase in the click-through rate of the CTA button. In other words, Corcentric’s website got 99% more clicks in just 2 weeks after it added the word “free” to its CTA on the home page.\nHere’s why this small change resulted in big gains.\nThe word “free,” as mentioned in an article by Shopify, is one of 4 words with the ability to engage with customers at a subconscious level. The word “free” has also featured in almost every marketer’s list of must-use words in headlines, CTAs, and copy. And if neuroscience marketing blog is to be believed, FREE! is more powerful than any rational economic analysis would suggest.",

        "raw_contents": "About GRENE\nGrene’s history has its origin in 1915 Denmark, when its founder, Chr. C. Grene, started whole-selling agricultural production items. But in Poland, it began in 1996 after privatization. Today, it has become the most recognized brand of stores, with over 100 years of experience, selling spare machine parts, zootechnical products, seeds, tires, tools, small equipment, specialist protective clothing, and agricultural toys. Grene also supplies products that match individual requirements.\nGRENE has been using VWO Services since November 2018, and the VWO Platform since even before that.\nGoals\nFor each of the campaigns discussed in this success story,  the end goal was different:\nCampaign 1: Make it easier for users to find desired products on the mobile listing pages\nCampaign 2: Make their USP more prominent on the website\nCampaign 3: Increase click-through to the cart page\nTests run\nGRENE, in collaboration with VWO Services, ran a series of campaigns to optimize their website and improve conversions. Discussed below are various campaigns that drove a significant increase in conversions for GRENE:\nCampaign 1: Testing the horizontal layout on the category listing pages – mobile. \nGoal: Make it easier for users to find desired products on the mobile listing pages from the gamut of options available. \nChallenge: In the old version, the product boxes were occupying too much space on the limited mobile screen space available, and the users were finding it difficult to scroll down too much in order to find what they were looking for. \nSolution: This is what control looked like:\nTo make finding products easier, VWO Services along with the team at GRENE decided to optimize the use of available screen space by downsizing the space each product used to display information. The CTA button too was replaced by a cart icon with a circular perimeter of red color which upon clicking changed color to green indicating that the action is complete i.e., the product has been added to cart. This is what the variation looked like:\nThe change expected was that the users would have to scroll down less with the new design, resulting in increased impressions on each product and higher clicks. You can easily check the scroll-depth of your pages to optimize them for CTAs using VWO Insights. Take a free trial to know more!\nResult: The campaign ran for a period of 46 days (June 13, 2019 – July 28, 2019) and the variation won with a 43.03% conversion rate against control’s 36.81% conversion rate and a confidence level of 100%. Along with this, clicks on product boxes increased by 178, which was a 15.50% increment, and a 16.89% increase in CVR. The changes also resulted in a 10% increase in click-through to cart page and a 10% increase in visits to the Thank You page.\n  Campaign 2: Revising USP’s content and redesigning its layout – desktop\nGoal: Make GRENE’s USP more prominent on the website\nChallenge: GRENE has 4 USP’s which were highlighted above-the-fold on the homepage, occupying the prime property. However, the USP’s looked visually bland and failed to grab the users’ attention. \nSolution: This is what control looked like:\nVWO Services redesigned the way the company’s USPs were displayed – unlike the bland color in control, the variation had the USPs highlighted in bright, green color. The hypothesis was that introducing green color to the icons displaying the USPs would result in increased impressions. \nAlong with the color change, the USP’s were broken down into two parts with keywords in the first row and related important content in the second. The hypothesis was that this change would make it easier for users to consume the benefits GRENE offered and thus complete the entire buyer’s journey. \nThis is what the variation looked like:\nResult: The campaign ran for a period of 15 days (May 9, 2019 – May 23, 2019). The metrics tracked were Interaction/ Clicks on the USP’s and eCommerce CVR. The test results showed a phenomenal spike in the user interaction with these USPs, which rose from 0.26% in the control version to 2.28% in the variation, with a 100% confidence level. Additionally, the eCommerce CVR shot up from 2.64% to 3.18% during this period.\n  Campaign 3: Redesigning mini cart – desktop\nGoal: Increase click-through to the cart page\nChallenge: A lot of users were clicking on the FREE DELIVERY USP’s highlighted above the main CTA button, assuming it is a button. The users were also unable to see the total sum value of each product if more than 1 product was added to the cart. In addition to that, users had to scroll all the way to the bottom of the mini cart to click on the main CTA button, which increased the evaluation time of the products added to the cart. \nSolution: This is what control looked like:\nThe hypothesis behind this campaign was that adding a CTA button at the top of the mini cart would help users quickly transition to the cart page. Also, a more sorted layout with a ‘remove’ button on the right (to avoid any unwanted clicks), the addition of the multiplied value of products and a bigger CTA button would motivate users to go further down the conversion funnel and complete their journey. This is what the variation looked like:\nResult: The campaign ran for 36 days (April 4, 2019 – May 9, 2019) and the metrics tracked were – visits on the cart page, revenue or quantity purchased, and ecommerce CVR:\nVisits to the cart page increased, declaring the variation as the winner with a 3.05% conversion rate against 2.91% from control\nOverall eCommerce conversion rate increased from 1.83% to 1.96% during this period\nThe quantity purchased witnessed an almost 2X increase\nConclusion\nGRENE has been using VWO to A/B test all their experience optimization ideas with the help of VWO Services. Owing to this, from 2017-2018, they witnessed an uplift in several metrics that have a direct bearing on their business:\n  UPLIFT IN KEY METRICS FROM 2018 – 2019\n  eCommerce CVR \n13.69%\nTransactions\n81% \nRevenue \n59.90%\nUnique Purchases\n63.85%\nQuantity\n60.41% \nOptimize your campaigns to fuel your website conversions with VWO.

The website helps people find the property that best suits them through innovative technology solutions, including their mobile app. For Locations Hawaii, it’s all about helping find the right property for them and making transactions as stress-free as possible in the process. Earning the trust and respect of the people of Hawaii each year is one of their proudest achievements, and they remain committed to the diverse island community. \nLocations Hawaii believes that real estate isn’t about the property, it’s about people. They achieve their goals by helping people achieve their own personal goals. It’s how they achieved $1.7B in sales in 2019!\nLocations Hawaii has been using VWO since 2018 for their website’s conversion rate optimization and experimentation programs. We got in touch with Joe Segal, Digital Marketing Manager, who steers website optimization to increase traffic leads, and business results, among other key activities.\nGoals\nThe main objective for Joe is to deliver optimized experiences on the Locations Hawaii website while generating more user inquiries for business results. To achieve this, besides looking at user behavior data, he also has to come up with new ideas that can help increase user inquiries. One such idea, along with its optimization has been covered in this success story.\nObservations\nProperty inquiries generated on the real estate search website are what drive the business. Joe’s challenge was to increase the number of inquiries being generated from the property details pages. To do this, he decided to step into the users’ shows and came up with ideas.\nTests run\nJoe hypothesized that by changing the call to action from “Inquire,” to a more value-added “Contact Agent” button on the property details pages, they will observe more user inquiries. He also thought that moving that button higher up in the fold and increasing it’s font size would result in more people asking questions about properties. This would lead to a stronger call to action which is also easier to see on the page.\nTwo variations were created based on these two ideas:\nA change of CTA from “Inquire” to “Contact Agent” with an increased font size\nMoving the new CTA (“Contact Agent”) above\n100% traffic visiting any property page (using the “URL Matches” capability in the campaign setting section of VWO) became a part of the test. The A/B Test was run with three variations, and traffic was distributed equally among the variations. The test ran for 26 days with 37,000 visitors becoming a part of it. Variation 2 emerged as the winner with a 22.97% improvement in performance (conversion rates for user inquiry generation) over the control. Start your free trial today to see which design is the real winner for your website.\nConclusion\nIn the first week and a half, when there wasn’t enough data, the variations were losing big time to the control. It took over two weeks, but eventually, the variations started to do better, even gaining as high as 100% improvement over the control. Joe’s theory is that people who were already using the website regularly were thrown off by the new button wording, but over time they got used to it. This also comes to show that you need to give tests enough time to run before you make any decisions.\nJoe’s next step is to test more variations of the “Schedule Virtual tour” button call to action wording on the property detail page. Start your free trial today to be sure about the changes you make on your website.\nVWO is hands down the best tool I have ever used for planning, execution, and reporting on website testing and results. When I needed help, the VWO support staff was ALWAYS there to work with me through the details and get it right, no waiting. Now I have positive results to report to the bosses.\nJoe Segal\nDigital Marketing Manager",

I was able to run a solid A/B test with real business outcomes on just the free plan. I’ll definitely consider upgrading as we scale our tests.\nTiago Penteado\nHead of Marketing\nGoals\nPacked with a lot of features, Orah enables schools and organizations to manage different aspects of student experiences. The team wanted to optimize the site for first-time visitors, allowing them to quickly understand what the platform offered and navigate to appropriate pages for more insights. This way, they would be able to consume more information and feel motivated to click for a demo. \nObservations\nAn incongruity in visitor behavior was identified after running user tests on the website. But they had tested similar hypotheses in the past and achieved only a mediocre increase in conversion rates. However, this time, by combining qualitative and quantitative feedback, the team created a clear hypothesis, set proper user goals, and even aligned them to their business goals.\nHypothesis\nThe team hypothesized that rearranging or tweaking certain sections on the website’s homepage would help the new visitors better understand the company’s offerings. Easy findability of relevant information, they expected, would further motivate visitors to sign up for a demo. \nTests run\nBased on the hypothesis, an A/B test was run on the company’s website using VWO Testing. The following changes were noticed in the variation for the test:\nA smaller number of menu options in the navigation bar was expected to help visitors quickly find the relevant pages if they wanted to navigate through the website.\nThe use of industry terms in the website copy would help first-time visitors derive value as they are more familiar with industry jargon than brand-specific terms.\nShifting the testimonials to the top would prompt visitors to sign up on noticing similar schools or organizations selecting the platform. \nHere are the control and variation images for the test. \nThe A/B test was run for 11 days and the variation emerged as the winner. The primary goal, clicks on request for a demo, increased by 63.27%.\nFurther, the product page clicks and free sign-up clicks increased by 101.41% and 121.41% respectively. \nConclusion\nThe Orah team learned that positioning their products using industry-recognized terms vs. branded terms makes a big difference to new visitors on their website. The customers use their branded terms and are familiar with them, but it was unnecessary friction for first-time visitors.\nVWO is an integrated experimentation platform that facilitates consistent scaling of your optimization program with its advanced capabilities.

It shows why using larger product images on your category or product pages might be better than providing product information.\nConversion rate optimization agency Optimics used VWO as an A/B testing software on the site of their client Mall.cz.\nGoals\nAmong many other tests, Optimics wanted to see if larger product images had any impact on sales and revenue. The primary goal was to increase sales.\nTests run\nOptimics created two variations—the first had slightly larger product images and the second had larger images with description showing up on mouseover.\nControl – Original size of product images along with text description\nVariation 1 – Large product images with text\nVariation 2 – Large product images with text description viewable on mouse over\nConclusion\nVariation 2 with the large images and product description viewable on mouseover was the winner. It resulted in a straight 9.46% increase in revenue (96% chance to beat original) with exactly zero Czech korunas spent on advertising.\nMarek Cais from Optimics told us that larger product images seemed to work better regardless of product type. While “an image speaks a thousand words” is a well-known adage, it obviously works for eCommerce too. Drawing comparisons with shopper behavior in brick-and-mortar stores, you’ll see that customers walk in, look at a variety of products, settle on one or two, and then spend some time looking at them closely. If the product is something like a pair of shoes, they’ll even try them on and then walk in front of the mirror.\nIn all cases, they are looking at the product as they make the journey from interest, desire, and finally action. Nicely shot product images essentially mimic this pattern, allowing website viewers to have a good look at the object of their interest before buying.\nIteratively optimize your website and drive business growth with VWO testing.

        "raw_contents": "About Susty Party\nSusty Party creates disposable tableware for parties. This Brooklyn, New York-based venture sells compostable yet colorful, highly-functional, and responsibly made plates, spoons, forks, glasses, and other items sourced from nonprofit factories that employ and empower visually impaired people. In their own words, they “respect the earth and party on,” so it is only fitting that the “susty” in the brand’s name stands for “sustainable.”\nSusty Party was featured in a number of influential media circles, so its website was attracting sizeable traffic. But sales conversions were low. In other words, people visited the website, but did not purchase their products.\nTo drive engagement and sales from its website traffic, they reached out to Uplift ROI, the conversion rate optimization experts who use VWO for helping clients with their conversion optimization(CRO) needs.\nGoals: Redesign Specific Website Elements to Increase Conversions\nFrom website data and analytics, it emerged that Susty Party experienced a high bounce rate on its home page. Visitors to the site left without much engagement. Even visitors who engaged, left before a sale was consummated. This led to poor conversion along the sales funnel.\nThis gave the digital marketing agency a direction to work on. Given the home page design and execution, it became clear that Susty Party could improve conversions by adopting some best practices widely followed in eCommerce circles.\nThe agency’s primary goal was to increase conversion on the home page through clicks on the banner. The secondary goal was to enhance the CTA clicks on the checkout page.\nTests run: Website Changes Were Driven by Data and Aligned to Visitor Behavior\nThe agency team developed some hypotheses around how click-throughs and conversions could be improved. They identified improvement possibilities on both the home page and the checkout page.\nOn the Home Page\nA clear USP: The Susty Party home page (at that time) lacked a clear USP. The agency hypothesized that adding a clear, selling proposition would help visitors understand the benefits of Susty Party and nudge them them toward greater engagement on the site.\nTestimonials were lacking at that time. It was hypothesized that adopting this staple among eCommerce best practices by adding real customer testimonials would help lift conversions on the home page.\nThere was no CTA on the banner, so another hypothesis was around adding a CTA to increase conversions.\nRemoving Videos: This was counterintuitive. But the older version of the Susty Party website contained product videos right on the page fold. So, it was hypothesized that the videos were a distraction that drove visitors away from completing the desired action on the page, which was a click-through to the product page.\nOn the Checkout Page\nAdding Security Affirmation: The eCommerce checkout page lacked any security affirmations. The agency hypothesized that adding one would encourage visitors to click “checkout.”\nThe agency developed a variation and A/B tested it against the original page (the control). Both screenshots are shown below.\nConclusion: 250% Increase in Conversions from the Home Page; 98.4% Increase in Checkouts\nThe changes to the home page and checkout pages yielded super results. Conversions from the home page increased by a mammoth 250% at 99.99% confidence level. That’s like saying there is almost ‘0’ chance for this to have happened by fluke. The checkout page also benefited from the change. With the variation, checkouts saw a 98.4% spike at a 97% confidence level.\nThe changes made to the home page did indeed cause more visitors to convert. Also, remember that the older version contained no CTA and, therefore, clicks on the home page banner were expected to be low. Even so, that doesn’t take away from the fact that the variation engaged visitors much better, enticing them to click the CTA through to the product page.\nWell-constructed hypotheses, combined with A/B testing, helps optimize conversions. When you partner with VWO, you not only get robust features but also perspectives, insights, and practical advice that will help you get more out of your investments in conversion optimization. Here are some insights to explain how and why the website changes boosted Susty Party’s conversion rates.\nChanges to the Home Page\nClear USP\nOperating in a niche of their own, the client had a reason to believe the images on the home page were self-explanatory. The oversight was that users have a million distractions. You literally get 5 milliseconds to make a good impression. If, in a couple of seconds, you do not give visitors a good enough reason to remain on your site, they will leave. Not only must your site have a good enough reason, but also convey the same effectively, in a couple of seconds. That is why adding this banner helped.\nIt establishes both points of parity and points of difference. The visitor immediately understands that Susty Party is about partyware and the fact that its products are non-toxic and compostable differentiate them from partyware sold by others. The subheading makes it clear that the business is North America-based and thus contributes to the region’s economy. Visitors also see that by buying Susty Party products, they would be helping the disadvantaged.\nThe most important point is that visitors are given all this information in one place and are not inconvenienced by having to find all this out by themselves. The marketing message in the heading is quite clear.\nTestimonials\nGenuine customer testimonials essentially let you say this: See, we are awesome, but you don’t have to take our word for it. Listen to what these guys, who are just like you and have already used our product, say about us.\nUsing testimonials on eCommerce pages has become so prevalent that users more or less expect them. Most visitors think on the lines of: If your product is as good as you claim it to be, you must have lots of customers. And if they like it, they would’ve said something good about you. Ergo, if you don’t have real customer testimonials, I don’t see how I can trust your product.\nCTA on the Home Page Banner\nIf there is no specific call-to-action that guides visitors to the next step of the funnel, many of them will leave. Think of your eCommerce website as a maze, at the end of which you have placed some goodies. Your visitors are wanderers who have deliberately walked into the maze, hoping to find something they like and are willing to pay for. You need them to browse the maze and find exactly what they need. (Okay, it’s a maze they can walk right out of, anytime they so wish, but you get the point!). But for now, they are disoriented and directionless and look to you for guidance. Every twist and turn inside the maze is a decision they need to make. And they won’t know what to do unless you tell them exactly where to turn and what they can expect around the corner.\nCTAs are the signboards to guide and direct. These need to be put up generously, at every turn you need visitors to take. Call-to-Action buttons tell the visitor what they are supposed to do, and what they can expect upon doing it.\nRead this comprehensive post on CTA buttons, what works, and why.\nAlso, how about some awesome flat-design CTA freebies you can start using right away? Click the button below to download, no landing pages, no nothing. Just some awesome free goodies.. It’s a zip file with .ai, .psd and .eps files included. If you like what you get here, you can thank Shawn Rubel at Vecteezy and check out what else they’ve got there.\nRemoving Videos\nI love this part because removing videos is not a best practice by any means. There are dozens of success stories that extol the use of videos as a means to effect greater conversions. This one for instance. Or this.\nWhy then, didn’t the videos work for Susty Party? Primarily because they were not as relevant as testimonials. Although the videos took up precious real estate on the home page, they were not as relevant for visitors as were the testimonials. Think about this: if you were looking for party-ware and landed on Susty Party’s website, would you be more interested in a video that showed how party cups looked or would you be keen to know what other customers who have used the products felt about them? I’d put my money on the latter.\nProducts like party-ware would typically require low involvement from the customer; they don’t cost much, and they don’t last long enough for a customer to put too much thought into the buying decision. More than a comprehensive understanding of the product, consumers of such products look to understand if they are value for money. Would the cups leak? Can these be disposed of easily? Are these microwave friendly? Hardly questions whose answers would need you to watch videos, right?! An FAQ section with product images might be of greater help and would help visitors make quick decisions.\nChanges to the Checkout Page\nAdding security affirmation is vital. Say, you just became a father and are throwing a party for your dear ones. Scouting for good party-ware, you come across Susty Party and find the product to be refreshingly new. So you click, click, and click some more till you get to the product page. You are a seasoned online buyer so you realize that this is the point of no return. You have to make a decision that involves spending money. More importantly, your decision could impact the success of your party.\nSuddenly, there are doubts, apprehensions, and lack of trust. You don’t see any trust badges or guarantee badges, or affirmations. Nothing that tells you that you can trust the products or the seller. So you do what you do. You leave. Or, in another universe, you see it on the checkout page.\nDo not rely blindly on “best practices.” Or test for the sake of testing. Identify your concerns, study the data, and understand what the data says. Construct hypotheses based on what the data tells you and not on the basis of what best practices tell you. Sure, best practices could act as references, and you might even be able to reverse engineer your way to find what could be improved on the site. But do not consider best practices (or blind A/B testing, for that matter) to be shortcuts to a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\nBecause A/B testing isn’t that rainbow. Your website is.\nIt is up to you to decide the shape and colors of your rainbow. A/B testing can only help you figure out what kind of rainbows are more likely to attract people.",

        "raw_contents": "About Encyclopedia Britannica\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica Group is a global knowledge leader whose products inspire curiosity and enthusiasm for learning across multiple platforms and devices. The organization celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2018.\nEncyclopedia Britannica became a pioneer in digital learning starting in the 1980s. Today, the company serves 150 million students, lifelong learners, and professionals in 83 countries and 16 languages. \n“We’re excited to continue sharing all of the knowledge we have and being a part of people’s lives, even though it’s no longer through printed books,” says Elizabeth.\nOver the five years, Elizabeth has spent with Encyclopedia Britannica, her role has evolved to oversee consumer subscriptions, marketing, analytics, and research. When she identified an opportunity to increase Encyclopedia Britannica’s user base and subscriptions, as well as improve its website, the company’s journey to a partnership with VWO began.\n  Elizabeth Romanski, Consumer Marketing and Analytics Manager at Encyclopedia Britannica\nObservations\n1. The shift to digital—innovating to keep pace with EdTech’s rapid evolution\n  Although the success of its digital products prompted Encyclopedia Britannica to cease\npublication of its printed encyclopedias in 2012, the organization had to continue to innovate,\nknowing the next logical step was to shift to a purely digital platform. Transitioning from its role as a well-known print publisher to a digital platform was a challenge for Encyclopaedia\nBritannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica needed to align its digital strategy with users’ frequently\nevolving needs and ensure that it outperformed the competition. The organization needed the\ncapability to test new initiatives to continue to remain a knowledge leader, this time in the\ndigital age.\n2. Tools and system limitations, as well as dependency on external teams\nEncyclopedia Britannica experimented with A/B testing over the past decade and used a few different products; however, the products didn’t provide enough flexibility. The products were difficult to implement and use, and the company couldn’t run new tests outside of a software release. Therefore, it was still relying heavily on in-house developers. This made work cumbersome, and testing became an afterthought because the process was clunky and time-consuming.\n3. Going beyond just A/B testing\nTo transition smoothly to a digital landscape, the organization needed a solution that would allow it to build stellar user experiences, and easily create and run tests without coding or IT’s involvement. Encyclopedia Britannica needed a technology partner that could provide insight into its users’ behaviors and needs, and support it in the long term with flexible testing capabilities and powerful analytics.\n“Nowadays, you have to establish loyalty with your customers and use data to drive innovations that will deliver an excellent user experience. You have to test things to see what works for your audience—even things as simple as changing a button color.” Elizabeth says. \nTests run: Implementing a user-friendly, data-driven solution\nEncyclopedia Britannica did a lot of research before contacting VWO, and ultimately determined that the solution’s intuitive user interface and the ability to make changes and gather insights quickly made it the right fit.\n“You don’t need a website development background to make VWO work for you—and you don’t need to wait on release cycles” \nElizabeth Romanski\nManager of Consumer Marketing and Analytics\nWhen Encyclopedia Britannica implemented VWO, the organization took advantage of its learning resources and training sessions. The company started conducting small tests to give its marketing team insight into how they could use the solution. Now, Encyclopedia Britannica consistently uses VWO to test and improve its digital products.\n  Gathering insights to drive strategy\nAfter nearly three years of using VWO, Encyclopedia Britannica has gained greater visibility into its users’ behaviors and needs. Here are a few of the ways Encyclopedia Britannica used VWO to test and discover the best performing versions of its website, diagnose problem areas, improve user experience, and drive conversions and revenue.\n    Test 1: Figuring out which color is best for links\nHypothesis: Users are more likely to identify a link if the link text is in blue.\nRationale: Blue is a universal color that people associate with links. Presenting clickable text in blue eliminates confusion and allows users to find the information they are looking for quickly.\nImplementation: Encyclopaedia Britannica used VWO Testing to easily create and run tests to compare the results of the three CTA options. The company tested different popups with Encyclopaedia Britannica using VWO Insights to watch session recordings. The team noticed that many users tried to click on words that were blue, but these words weren’t actual links. This led the organization to want to understand if blue needed to be the only color used for links. Encyclopaedia Britannica created a few tests on a select number of articles and experimented with three colors for in-line article links: red, orange, and blue (control). With the calls to action to see which one worked better.\nResults: The hypothesis turned out to be true. The other colors reduced engagement by an average of 10%. As a result, Encyclopedia Britannica continued using blue for all of its links, and made sure no non-link text was blue.\nVariation\nControl\nTest 2: Comparing call-to-action (CTA) variables\nHypothesis: The CTAs “Become a subscriber” or “Become a member” will yield higher conversion rates than the control: “Start your free trial”.\nRationale: The words “subscriber” and “member” imply that someone is part of a community so these words will have more impact than “free trial.”\nImplementation: Encyclopedia Britannica used VWO Testing to easily create and run tests to compare the results of the three CTA options. The company tested different popups with the calls to action to see which one worked better.\nResults: Surprisingly, all variations performed worse than the control (“Start your free trial”). In some cases, the click-through rate on the CTA dropped by 20%. Based on this data, Encyclopedia Britannica knew its control language was best and stuck with it.\nWith VWO, you can easily test which CTA works best for you. Take a free trial to see how!\n  Control\nVariation 1\nVariation 2\nTest 3: Evaluating new product feature effectiveness\nHypothesis: Q&A accordions will prevent users from leaving a webpage and going to Google for answers. \nRationale: The accordions will provide related information that users are interested in while they’re reading an article.\nImplementation: Encyclopedia Britannica identified high-traffic articles, then used VWO’s on-page survey capability to discover what people wanted to know most in relation to the topic. Next, the company designed an accordion feature on its website with the top Q&As for each article.\nResults: Over 23% of users tested clicked the accordion to see answers to the questions and click through to read more of the article or other related content.\nDiscover a goldmine of insights on your visitor’s peculiar behavior with VWO Insights. Take a free trial today to explore more of its features.\nControl\nVariation\nConclusion: Empowering and connecting a team dedicated to user experience\nWith the data it has gained from VWO, Encyclopaedia Britannica has now become well versed in testing and has more insight into who its users are, what they like and dislike about the company’s products and how the products need to evolve as a result. The organization no longer needs to rely so heavily on its developers either because VWO provides 24×7 support.\n“The VWO support team is amazing,” Elizabeth says. \nVWO has empowered Encyclopaedia Britannica to give more of its staff a say in decision making. The VWO solution provides the freedom to try new initiatives because when someone has an idea, Encyclopaedia Britannica can easily test it to see if it resonates with users—the organization isn’t bound to one approach. The company also uses VWO to break down internal silos. Now, staff from different teams work together using the solution and sharing their results.\nVWO enables you to easily discover insights, build an experimentation roadmap, test ideas, and engage visitors, all within a single platform. Start your free trial today!\nWhat’s next for Encyclopedia Britannica and VWO\nIn the future, Encyclopedia Britannica intends for VWO to become a standard part of its workflow when considering product changes. So far, the organization has used VWO to improve its Britannica website, and plans to test its Britannica Kids website next. The company is also testing other potential consumer products with VWO, and hopes to involve its sister company Merriam-Webster.",

        "raw_contents": "About Who Accepts Amex\nWho Accepts Amex operates an affiliate model website based out of the UK. The site lists vendors that accept American Express cards and those that don’t. The company earns commissions from sales on other websites. Hence, every click on their website matters.\nGoals\nTo get more clicks on their website, and hence earn more commission, they hired Lone Goat, a web analytics and Conversion Rate Optimization agency that uses the VWO platform for its work.\nTests run\nLone Goat analyzed data from the Who Accepts Amex website to find the page(s) most suitable for their optimization efforts. One of their major findings was that despite having more page-views, the ‘companies’ page template of the website produced fewer external clicks per page compared to the ‘categories’ template.\nTherefore, this was the page chosen for the first optimization test. The first test they ran tried out different combinations of font styling – bold, underline, no styling, etc. – on links to the external websites. This test wasn’t successful and the control outperformed all variations.\nThe next test was to gauge the impact of font size on clicks. The objective was to determine if font size made a difference and if yes, which font size helped generate the largest number of clicks on the website.\nThis is how the original web page (the control) looked:\nThe control, which had website links in font-size 14px, was tested against 6 variations from font-size 12px to 18px (each variation had a 1px increment).\nThe test was run for a duration of 28 days over nearly 3100 website visitors. The goal of the test was to track the number of external website clicks.\nConclusion\nThe variation with font-size 18px emerged as the winner and recorded 32.68% more clicks.\nThis is how the winning 18-px version looked:\nAll but one variation performed somewhat better than the control. The only one that fared worse than the control was the variation with font-size 17px (just 1px less than the winning variation), which recorded 16.14% fewer clicks as compared to the control (14px font-size).\nIt is tempting to conclude that visibility and contrast of the webpage content improved with font-size, which made it easier for visitors, and hence led to the superior outcomes vis-a-vis the control. But this does not explain why the 17px variation did not do better (or even as well) as the 15px or 16px variations.\nOf course, even Google had trouble deciding the perfect blue for their toolbar and they (tested between 41 different shades of blue). Testing font-size is reported to be one an effective way to increase profits of your website. This list of 19 tests to improve conversion rates of your website also advises testing font-size.\nAs part of the ongoing conversion optimization process, Lone Goat planned to test effects of font-color and font-family as well.",

        "raw_contents": "About Casa Mineira\nCasa Mineira is a real estate company operating in Belo Horizonte, one of Brazil’s largest cities. In addition to a network of 8 physical offices spread across the city, the company also attracts leads through its website.\nThe company hired Supersonic, a Conversion Optimization consultancy in Brazil, to increase the number of leads generated by its website and improve conversions.\nGoals\nThe objective of this test campaign was to identify the easiest search options for users thereby increasing the number of leads generated by the website. The conversion goal that was tracked in VWO was the number of emails collected (leads generated).\nTests run\nThe original home page of the website had a neat and somewhat minimalist design above the fold. The headline, pointing toward a search box, asked people to find a property in Belo Horizonte. This is what control looked like:\nTo understand the behaviors and expectations of visitors to the site, Supersonic conducted email surveys, gathered onsite feedback (by using Qualaroo) and used exit surveys.\nOne observation that came out prominently from these was that visitors wanted to perform their search quickly and easily.\nRafael at Supersonic decided to test a variation to assess the effect it will have on conversions.\nThe hypothesis was that giving users clear choices would increase the usability of the search box. In turn, this would lead to more people leaving their email ids in the form for one of Casa Mineira’s brokers to contact them.\nAccordingly, the standard search box was replaced with 2 boxes containing drop-down menus. The first box had a drop-down list of apartment types; the second box had a list of locations to choose from. Since Casa Mineira operated only in one city, all major locations could be easily covered through a drop-down menu.\nThis is what variation looked like:\nThe new search bar was tested using VWO. A split URL test was set up, and close to 7,500 visitors became a part of the test.\nResult: The variation outperformed the original home page and got the company 57.25% increase in form submissions, thus generating more leads.\nConclusion\nAs conversion optimization experts, we are just as interested in figuring out why the variation worked. In this case, why did the Search Box with drop-down menus win? There are 2 likely reasons:\nThe drop-down search gave visitors a clear path of action: With a standard search box, the visitors had to be sure about what they were looking for. As the scope of a standard search box is limitless, they could type anything to describe what they were looking for. The drop-down search boxes covered all major locations and apartment types for the visitors, who had to select only what they were looking for from the list. This meant users had to think less about what to type in; it also eliminated the instances of typos and errors that could have led to “no matching listings”.\nThe drop-down made it possible for visitors to search for various combinations of apartment types and locations: In the original search where visitors had to type keywords, there was no clarity if users could type multiple locations at one time and how the search would respond if they wanted to look for more than one type of apartment in different locations. In the variation, visitors could select multiple locations and apartment types in one search. By offering users a set of predefined choices, Casa Mineira ensured that visitors could define their expectations clearly. This would help Casa Mineira offer more close matches with what visitors wanted, thus obtaining more and better-qualified leads.",

        "raw_contents": "About Trinity\nMany eCommerce retailers start A/B testing variations of that button to improve the click-through rate. That’s precisely what Trinity Insight, a VWO customer, did for their client Taylor Gifts.\nTrinity Insight is an award-winning agency that has helped numerous clients increase their website conversion rate. They are also one of our certified agencies.\nGoals\nThe main objective was to increase click-throughs on the “Add-to-Cart” button on their product page.\nTests run\nThe test was run on the dynamic product page. They used VWO’s advanced mode to create a test that runs across thousands of dynamic product pages on Taylor Gifts.\nHere’s what the original product page looked like:\nOriginal Product Page\nWe ran an A/B split test; however, we focused mainly on creating a buy box with all of the information relevant to the buying decision located in proximity to the Add to Cart action.\nThe hypothesis was that presenting information clearly in the variation would help people find the information they needed to make a decision faster and at a more convenient location, therefore, making them more likely to place the item in their cart.\nHere’s the variation tested:\nVariation Product Page (10% increase in click-throughs)\nConclusion\nThe variation experienced a 10% lift in the goal conversion on this page and the overall eCommerce conversion rate of the test subjects went up from 1.53% on the control to 3.23% on the variation. Needless to say, Taylor Gifts were very happy with the result!\nLessons from the Test\nPlacing the standard information we all use to make buying decisions in one easy to scan location makes a lot of sense from a sales standpoint. In traditional retail, ideally, a salesperson would be in close proximity of the item to answer questions about how much it is, and if it’s on sale how much you’re saving. They’d also let you know what other customers thought as so often we use our peers to help us make our decisions.\nProviding valuable eCommerce information near this box may also be a good idea as in how long will it take to get to me and what do I do if I have to return it. More detailed information is great on the page for people looking to make in depth research-based purchases, but the segment of customers who prefer to move quickly through this process will find lots of value in an efficient buy box strategy.\nRole of VWO\nVWO was irreplaceable in this test as we’ve done dynamic template tests like this in the past with Google WO and spent an inordinate amount of time creating a custom javaScript and would then need to work with the clients IT team to implement on their site whereas we were able to accomplish the same test with VWO all from within the administration area.

        "raw_contents": "About ReplaceDirect\nReplaceDirect, a VWO customer, is a successful Dutch ecommerce site. It’s one of the biggest retailers in the Netherlands in the field of parts and accessories for notebooks and other mobile equipment. Their main focus is on energy products like batteries and power supplies, but their product range is quite extensive.\nThey did an A/B test on their website for which they used VWO.\nGoals\nFor eCommerce sites, cart abandonment is one of the most frustrating aspects of business. Visitors abandon their shopping carts, because they are unsure about additional costs, or are surprised to find out (only after entering the payment process) that they are charged more than they expected.\nTo prevent such surprises, ReplaceDirect informs its prospective customers at an early stage that no shipping costs will be added.\nBut has the customer actually leveraged or retained that information?\nThis is what ReplaceDirect wanted to test: Will it help reduce cart abandonment if a clear order overview is provided during the initial steps of checkout?\nTests run\nMoving ahead with the test, the ReplaceDirect team tested the second step of the checkout procedure on its website. It’s the page where customers need to fill out their personal information and shipping address.\nThe team made several changes to the page. The most important change perhaps was the insertion of an order overview, comprising the product(s), total costs, and delivery date.\nReplaceDirect also mentioned several benefits of this page; these were changed to more relevant benefits, specifically matching this step in the order process. Finally, the layouts of the page and the form were changed to yield a cleaner look. Several fields, which were not absolutely necessary, were removed. Following are the screenshots:\nControl Page\nVariation Page: 25% Reduction in Cart Abandonment\nConclusion\nTheir new version performed significantly better, reducing cart abandonments by 25%. As a direct result of this reduction, they saw a 12% increase in sales (14% by the time of pushing all new traffic to the new page).\nReplaceDirect says they expected the new version to perform better, but an increase that high turned out to be a pleasant surprise. It’s always nice to have a 14% increase in sales, without releasing any new products or without spending money on ways to get more traffic to the website.\nWhen we asked them if they had any lessons for other eCommerce sites; here is what they had to say:\n“Try to give the customers exactly the information they need at that particular page or section and leave out the redundant. Always put yourself in the customer’s shoes. This may not be easy so: test it!“\nReplaceDirect also had some praise for VWO:\nVWO was very valuable. The ease to set up a test and real-time results made it great to work with.",

        "raw_contents": "About Tinkoff Bank\nTinkoff Bank, a major online financial services provider based out of Russia, was launched in 2006 by Oleg Tinkov. In a relatively short period of time, it has emerged among the top 4 credit card issuers in Russia. Global Finance named it Russia’s Best Consumer Digital Bank in 2015.\nTinkoff operates through a branch-less digital platform and, therefore, relies heavily on its website to find new customers. Therefore, the bank constantly explores new ways to improve its website conversion rate. A dedicated web analytics team plans and executes their conversion optimization strategies.\nGoals\nIncrease the Number of Visitors Submitting Completed Credit Card Application Forms\nTinkoff Bank lets users apply for a credit card through an application form on its website. Users filled up the application form and submitted it to the bank for approval. After the application was approved, the credit card would be dispatched to their home at zero shipment cost.\nThis was the original application page:\nThe application page on the website was fairly elaborate, consisting of a multistep form and details about the application process and the credit card plan. This was the page from where conversions (form-submits) occurred.\nAs the form involved multiple steps for completion, Tinkoff tracked each step of the form along with submissions for completed forms. Tinkoff refers to these conversions as short-application submits and long-application submits, respectively. Tinkoff’s ultimate goal was to increase these conversions.\nTests run\nConduct A/B Tests to Identify What Changes Delivered Better Conversions\nTinkoff’s CRO team used Adobe Site Catalyst to analyze website visitor data and found that the credit-card application page had a significant bounce rate. The team then brainstormed ways that would help users stay on the credit card application page and submit the completed form (that is, complete the conversion).\nThey team zeroed in on 3 elements of the webpage. The hypothesis was that introducing new features would improve user experience on the page and encourage conversions. However, the team needed to be absolutely sure about the effectiveness of these new features before applying changes to the webpage permanently.\nThere was only one way to do it objectively—through A/B testing.\nTinkoff used VWO to carry out A/B tests on the page to determine whether the planned changes would be beneficial in terms of increasing conversion rates. Three separate tests were conducted.\nTest 1 was around the hypothesis that providing additional details about the credit card above the form would increase the number of submitted applications.\nTinkoff created two variations of the original (control) page.\nThe first variation included a “More details” hyperlink underneath the “Fill out form” CTA button placed above the fold. When clicked, the hyperlink led to a new page which provided additional information about the credit card scheme. Here’s how it looked.\nThe second variation had the same More Details link below the CTA button. But this time, the link opened up a box right below that provided additional information about the credit card, through text and graphics.\nHere’s the second variation.\nThe test was run on more than 60,000 visitors for a period of 13 days.\nResults\nThe first variation couldn’t outperform the control; in fact, it had an even lower conversion rate than the control. The second variation, however, improved the page’s conversion rate by a remarkable 15.5%. Moreover, it beat the control every single time.\nTest 2 was around the hypothesis that providing a “progress bar” on top of the four-step application form would motivate users to fill the form completely, resulting in a higher conversion rate.\nHere again, Tinkoff designed 2 variations of the original form page.\nThe first variation had a yellow banner-like progress bar, right above the form. The progress bar highlighted which step the user was at. The user’s progress on completing the form was also displayed graphically through a black line at the bottom. The bar mentioned the probability of approval of a credit card based on how far the user had filled the form.\nThis is the first variation:\nThe second variation also had a progress bar, but with a different design.\nSimilar to the first variation, the second variation progress bar too displayed which step the user was at and the probability of approval of a credit card. But here, the progress bar was green in color. And it didn’t have the additional black line to graphically show the user’s progress on the form. Instead, the bar itself represented the user’s progression graphically: The green portion of the bar grew as users moved further on the form.\nThis is what this variation looked like.\nThe test was run for more than 190,000 visitors for a period of 39 days.\n\nResults\nBoth variations outperformed the control, and both had a 100% chance to beat the original page.\nThe first variation had a 6.9% higher conversion rate than the control, while the second variation improved conversion rates by an impressive 12.8%.\nTest 3 was around the hypothesis that by giving users an option to fill their passport details on the application form later, the number of form-submits would increase.\nOnly 1 variation that was pitted against the control.\nOn the original page, users were required to submit their passport-related information on the form’s second step. The variation gave an option to the users for completing this step later, using a Don’t remember passport details? checkbox. On clicking this checkbox, a small window appeared, asking users to choose phone or email by which they could provide their passport details later. Users could complete the form whenever they had their passport details handy.\nHere are the screenshots of the checkbox and the pop-up window.\nThe test was run on over 265,000 visitors for a period of 23 days.\n\nResults\nThe variation beat the the control page, improving the conversion rate by a whopping 35.8%. The after-filling conversion rate, too, increased by 10%. And in this test too, the variation had a 100% chance of beating the control.\nConclusion\nA/B Tests Help Deliver Double-Digit Increases in the Conversion Rates\nConversion rate optimization is not about testing random ideas on your website. It is about improving your website’s user experience through a coherent process. This process involves identifying areas of improvement on your website and suggesting changes based on traffic data and user behavior, and best practices. It is followed by A/B testing these changes and learning about the effectiveness of the changes. Only when the changes improve the conversion rate of your website do you apply them permanently.\nWe explain below the learning from each of the 3 A/B tests Tinkoff conducted, highlighting the underlying principles that can be applied to other conversion optimization efforts as well.\nTest 1\nPlacing key differentiators on a web page prominently is an important CRO best practice. Key differentiators enhance the image of a brand in the eyes of users and influence them to make a conversion. Tinkoff displayed its differentiators within a box, behind the More Details link.\nThe box clearly illustrated key differentiators such as free shipping of the card, free card recharge, and cash back on all purchases made through the card.\nFree shipping influences customers; in fact, lack of free shipping is the number one reason why people abandon their shopping carts. Therefore, displaying Free shipping prominently on the application page worked well for Tinkoff.\nNote: Although free shipping was already mentioned on the original page’s top right corner, it didn’t have much contrast against the background. It may not have been noticed by visitors. The variation, however, increased the chances of visitors spotting the much loved free shipping offer. A/B test the design, copy, and position of your CTAs with VWO to find one that gets maximum engagement. Start your 30-day, all-inclusive free trial now. \n  Reassuring users at each step of the conversion process improves the conversion rate. This is the reason trust badges, testimonials, and social proof work for so many websites. The features box on the application page reassured users about Tinkoff’s credibility because it provided key information: Tinkoff is the leading internet bank providing more than 300,000 points of recharge and how its service is completely digital and users don’t ever have to visit branches. This helped increase users’ trust in the bank’s services, thereby increasing form submits.\nThe A/B test also offered insights on why the first variation did not do well. The More details link on the first variation page led users to a new page with additional information about the credit card. This feature probably distracted some users away from the application form. And because web users have a short attention span, some users didn’t return to complete the form. In other cases, visitors may not have taken the trouble to visit the More details page, and so did not get to see the credit card features. The combined effect of these factors was to reduce the total number of credit card applications submitted.\nTest 2\nUsers generally do not like filling long forms on websites. They are willing to do so only when they expect equal or higher value in return. When users find lengthy forms, they often become anxious because they aren’t sure of gaining satisfactory value after completing the form. Many times, user anxiety causes them to bounce off the form (or the website altogether).(A/B test your form to find the optimal length that works for your website visitors. Take a free trial with VWO to understand how easy this is)! \nHowever, there are various website elements that can be used to reduce user anxiety, a progress bar being one of them.\nProgress bars help curb user anxiety by providing them a visual cue about the effort required to complete a process. It reassures users that the process is underway and will be completed in due time and effort. This keeps them from bouncing off the page, a conclusion that has been reached by various studies on website and application designing.\nMost users would have played video games of some kind and, therefore, would be familiar with progress bars displayed within such games. In video games, progress bars are usually associated with the gamer’s progress with respect to the game’s objective (or beating a certain opponent in the game at a certain stage of the game).\nTinkoff adopted a gaming style progress bar on the credit card application form page. The progress bar would only be fully filled when users completed the form. A partially filled progress bar motivated users to complete the form and submit it.\nTinkoff’s progress bar also used rewards, another gamification technique, to motivate users. Text was overlaid on the progress bar. For example, when users were on the second step of the form, the text read The probability of approval is 30% and Get 10% for Step 2 completion. As users invested time and effort in applying for their credit card, they would have wanted to maximize the probability of approval. By realizing that each step increased the probability of approval, users were further motivated to complete the application forms and submit them.\nThe A/B test also offered insights into why the second variation performed better: the progress bar had greater visibility. Providing contrast to your key elements on a webpage is the basic principle of web design. The first variation progress bar was a black line at the bottom of a yellow banner. As the color scheme of the overall page included white, gray, and yellow, the progress bar and the banner didn’t have much contrast. For some users, the progress bar could have easily blended with the page’s theme. Moreover, the progress bar was quite thin, which may have made it harder for some users to even notice it.\nThe second variation progress bar was green in color, giving it ample contrast and visibility on the page. The width of the bar, too, was large enough to make it noticeable to the users. And of course, after the progress bar was noticed by users, they came under its persuasive influence.\nTest 3\nThis test exemplified 3 important design principles, as highlighted below:\nAcknowledging users’ issues: The second step on the application form required detailed information about users’ passports (e.g. date of issue, series and number, code division etc.). Most users don’t have these details memorized or handy at the time of filling the form. This could have caused them to bounce off the form. With the variation offering users the option to submit the passport details later, users no longer had a reason to leave the application form partially-filled.\nProviding freedom to Users: After users clicked on the “Don’t remember passport details” checkbox on the page, they were given the option of completing the form via an email link or through a phone call with Tinkoff’s executives. The latter option reduced user effort and this feeling of “freedom” contributed to reduced bounce rates and in turn, increased conversions.\nVirtually shortening the form length: Once users chose to fill their passport details later, they were left with only two of the four steps to complete. So, effectively, users had already completed half of the application form—information that was reinforced by the progress bar on the form. As users had completed the first half of the form in a breeze, they looked forward to completing the next half equally quickly. The option to submit passport data through a phone call converted the form into virtually a 3-step process.",

As the only Indian firm with full-stack capabilities on industry-leading marketing and cloud platforms, Tatvic has established itself as a trusted name in the MarTech space, proudly serving renowned brands like Times of India, Titan Eye+, Aegon Life, Adani, ABP Network, and many others.\nAt Tatvic, data drives decisions. That’s why the company collaborates with VWO to conduct data-driven experiments to optimize conversions for its clients.\nGoals\nICICI Lombard, one of India’s leading general insurance companies, is a client of Tatvic. Tatvic’s team focused on enhancing ICICI Lombard’s lead conversion rate by optimizing the mobile user journey using VWO.\nWorking with Team Tatvic on our CRO engagement has been very positive. Their understanding of UX principles and data-driven experimentation optimized our mobile forms, increasing leads from mobile users. Their expertise has been valuable in meeting our business objectives and improving our mobile UX strategies.\nSanskar Dholi\nSr. AVP Product\nAt Tatvic, we collaborated with ICICI Lombard to enhance their digital experience by utilizing VWO for A/B testing. By leveraging VWO’s behavior analytics capabilities, we gained deep insights into user behavior, which allowed us to create well-informed hypotheses for our tests. The results of our experimentation were remarkable, leading to improved user engagement and conversion rates.\nAnuj Munshi\nHead of Experimentation\nObservations\nThe team at Tatvic conducted a detailed analysis of user data. This revealed that a large portion of ICICI Lombard’s audience interacted with the website via mobile devices, however many users abandoned the health insurance form when asked to enter their mobile number. \nFurther examination of the health insurance page revealed a critical gap in the user experience—the absence of essential information such as the plan’s name and its benefits. \nThis omission likely caused confusion and a lack of understanding among users, ultimately affecting lead submissions.\n  Hypothesis\nBased on the observations, Tatvic’s team hypothesized that by clearly communicating the policy’s value proposition at the mobile number entry point, they could retain users and improve form completion rates. \nThe team proposed enhancing the user experience through strategic placement of essential information and compelling call-to-action prompts. This approach aimed to address user confusion, reduce drop-offs, and increase overall engagement, leading to more qualified leads.\nTests run\nThe hypothesis needed to be validated with an A/B test using VWO.\nFor the test variation, the plan name, unique selling points (USP), and benefits of the policy were prominently displayed above the fold. Additionally, the “Get Quick Quote” CTA was repositioned to the bottom of the page and made sticky to increase accessibility and user clicks.\nMost importantly, the mobile number field was placed at the very beginning of the form. \nThis strategy ensured that even if users drop off later, ICICI Lombard’s team can still follow up using the provided mobile numbers, potentially converting leads through direct contact.\nHere’s how the variation compared to the control:\nThe A/B test yielded impressive results, with the variation outperforming the control.\nThere was a 30.09% increase in form completions and interactions with the “Get a Quote” option, as well as a 44.25% rise in mobile number submissions.\nConclusion\nTatvic achieved remarkable results for its client, ICICI Lombard, significantly boosting lead conversion rates. VWO was instrumental in this success, offering powerful testing capabilities that ensured accurate and dependable outcomes.\nYou too can leverage VWO to improve your conversion rates.

        "raw_contents": "About Media Contour\nMedia Contour is a Dallas-based digital agency that offers digital marketing, and conversion rate optimization services. Their business goal is to ensure that their collaboration with clients and the results they deliver maximize traffic and sales. To achieve this goal, they put their creative zeal and passion for excellence into building cutting-edge strategies.\nThe team uses VWO to analyze visitor behavior and run experiments on clients’ websites so that they only ship designs that are proven to convert traffic as backed by real data.  \n    VWOs integrated heat/clickmaps and reporting make it extremely easy for us to convey a clear message of success to our clients.\nBenjamin Dandurand\nOperations Manager\nIn this case study, we discuss a recent successful experiment that the Media Contour team ran for their client – Life Pro Fitness. \nGoal\nThe team used VWO heatmaps, clickmaps, and session recordings to determine user pain points. A heuristic analysis helped them determine the areas for big wins. \nThe team backed this with a competitive industry analysis to determine how much ground they needed to cover to hit a realistic and attainable conversion rate. Lastly, funnel drop-off analysis helped them determine where to focus their changes.\nBased on this, they decided that there was scope to improve the revenue per visitor generated from the product detail pages on their client’s website.\nObservations\nThe Media Contour team observed that visitors to the Life Pro Fitness website were having to search for useful information needed to convert. Hence they decided to move all this information above the fold and reduced the number of CTAs to nudge the visitors to take specific actions.\nTests run\nThe team hypothesized that moving important information about the product and CTAs to the first fold will improve the conversions on the product details pages. \nBased on this, the following were the main changes tested on the page:\nAdditional product images were moved from below the main image and placed vertically beside the image so that they were visible without a scroll. \nThe product description, which included key features, was moved to the first fold of the page.\nThe Add-to-cart and Buy now CTAs were placed clearly in the first fold of the page. \nThis is how the control and variation looked as the test was run:\nVWO heatmaps for the control and variation showed that visitors that viewed the variation had higher engagement than those who viewed the original design or the control. (Heatmaps use colors to indicate the intensity of visitor engagement on different sections of a page; warm colors like red and yellow show higher engagement and cool colors like green show lower engagement.)\nThis is how the heatmaps looked:\nVariation 1 was declared a smart winner with an improvement of 15.63% in conversion rate in a matter of 27 days. The team tracked the improvement in revenue using VWO during the test and fetched an uplift of $0.67 per visitor. \nThis brought the expected total revenue from $76,841 to $88,698.\nConclusion\nThe team documented the learnings from this test; this included the importance of determining the right number of CTAs on PDPs and finding out what information is crucial for users before they make a conversion. Making this information easy to find (or above the fold) was extremely useful for the team to successfully conclude this experiment. \nTake an all-inclusive free trial with VWO to understand how you can easily run tests and amplify the power of experimentation with integrated heatmaps and other visitor behavior analysis tools.

        "raw_contents": "About Bizztravel Wintersport\nA leading player in the Dutch online travel industry, the Bizz Travel Group, specializes in creating its own leisure products and selling them directly to consumers through its websites. Bizztravel Wintersport is a part of the Bizz Travel Group and specializes in skiing holiday packages in the Alps.\nBizztravel Wintersport used VWO tools to test changes to its website that would improve conversions.\nGoals\nThe company undertook A/B testing to test the best navigation design that would enable better visitor engagement by making information easily accessible thereby improving its conversion rate.\nTests run\nThis is what Bizztravel’s original navigation and region page looked like:\nGoogle Analytics statistics revealed that:\nSite search is used often to search for ski village names, such as Gerlos and Val Thorens.\nAbout 23% of visitors enter through the home page, but the rest enter deeper into the site. They are forced to try and navigate through a Country > Region > Village system to find a ski village.\nA visitor clicks an average of 5 times before clicking a ski village link.\nBizztravel Wintersports’ site navigation did not reflect the manner in which visitors looked for a winter sports vacation. On clicking the tabs on the header, visitors were taken to the region page that didn’t show them the information they were looking for. Consequently, they were forced to browse through a ski region layer before getting to ski villages.\nFor example, many visitors do not know that the village of Flaine is located in the region of Le Grand Massif. So, to find the Flaine page on the original website, a visitor had to click through an average of 5 regions. The site navigation caused visitors to get lost during the seemingly simple task of finding a vacation. Not surprisingly, many visitors bounced.\nThe bottom line: About 75% of visitors never even saw the website home page!\nThe Bizztravel team decided to simplify navigation to ensure that visitors would find what they were looking for. They came up with a new page header with navigation structured in such a way that visitors could find and visit target pages from anywhere on the site.\nThe underlying premise was that a clear and simple navigation menu would allow visitors to find their desired page faster, and this would reduce early exits caused by frustration. It was also expected that these changes would increase conversion rates. VWO heatmaps were used to analyze where users spent the most time. This provided clues to what the most prominent offerings on the header ought to be.\nBased on the information gathered and subsequent analysis, the following changes were made to the navigation header:\nDirect links to ski villages (such as Gerlos, Val Thorens, and Flaine) were added.\nDirect links were added to special marketing theme pages (examples: Christmas and New Year vacations).\nA link to a list of Bizztravel’s 10 most popular ski village destinations was added.\nCountry flags were added to make it easy for visitors to figure out where the destination was.\nCompany information and less relevant links were moved to the footer.\nThe variation had a drop-down menu that reduced the need for visitors to rummage through the clutter of information in the control. The variation gave visitors easier access to information they might be looking for, say “Top 10 skiing destinations in France.”\nThe navigation A/B test pitted the variation against the original (control). The primary goal of the A/B test was to track visits to Bizztravel’s “Thank You” page (Bedankt). During the test, visitors were randomly directed to either the control page that showed the old header or the variation that incorporated all the design changes outlined above.\nBizztravel’s winning variation looked like this:\nResult: Compared to the original, the redesigned navigation registered a 21.34% higher goal completion. The results had an associated confidence level of 97%.\nConclusion\nThe results of this test offered useful insights for web design and navigation:\nThe navigation menu should be designed keeping in mind user preferences. Understand what the user expects, and then design the menu accordingly.\nThe menu should have clear subcategories. List only the most important ones, as a long drop-down list can overwhelm visitors.\nAll pages of the website should display the navigation menu so that a visitor can access any page from anywhere on the site.\nPay attention to how tabs are named so that visitors get exactly what you say you offer (and what they expect).",

Customers from several countries around the globe order their exclusive products through its eCommerce website.\nThe company uses the VWO platform for its website optimization requirements.\nGoals\nThe company’s eCommerce site and its product comparison page received sufficient traffic. However, engagement on its website was relatively low. This led to low conversions to sales. So, the objective of this campaign was to improve engagement and sales.\nTests run\nThis is what the original product comparison page looked like:\nAs Emily from Underwater Audio said, “The (rather) unattractive table had information in terse phrases organized in no particular fashion (activity, seal, size, features, warranty, depth). The paragraphs continued below the fold and essentially repeated the table, with only a few unique additions hidden in the text. In short, it was not the most engaging page!”.\nThe test hypothesis was that providing product information concisely to make it easier for visitors to comprehend the key features and benefits of different products available would highlight the value clearly and enable prospects to make the purchase decision easily.\nUnderwater Audio created a Challenger page and A/B tested it against the original page. The test was set up and run by using the VWO platform.\n\nThis is what variation looked like:\nThe redesigned page (the variation) featured the following changes:\nProduct specifications were organized under easy-to-read headings that represented typical  information elements that prospects needed to make their decision. Product features and specifications were detailed for better clarity.\nAdditional information about 2 headphones that was earlier detailed in the paragraphs below-the-fold was included in the table itself.\nInstead of showing several call-to-action links on the page, only one link to each product page was retained. This made the action on the page clearer for the visitors.\nThe table layout was improved; the whitespace on the page was better utilized to make the division between the columns clear without the thick cell borders that ruined the aesthetic appeal of the page.\nThe font of the page was changed to make it consistent with the rest of the site.\nConclusion\nThe test hypothesis was proved right, with the challenger beating the original to deliver 40.81% higher sales.\nHere’s the comparison image for easy reference:\nSo, why did the redesigned page prove to be more effective?\nCustomers expect specific information to help them make up their minds. Specificity is one of the most important basics of effective copywriting because it answers the visitor’s question around “what’s in it for me” (W.I.I.F.M.). Would you buy something online if you are not sure of its benefits?\n\nWebsites that provide such information are better positioned to persuade visitors to buy.\nThe redesigned page scored on these counts:\nIt provided prospects with the information they needed to make their decision. More important, the information was easy to spot and hence easy to read comprehend.\nIt eliminated distractions by reducing the number of call-to-actions on the page.",

The survey too threw up critical insights about Loft Resumes’ customers:\nAlthough their blog was the main source of traffic, customers also mentioned names of some other websites (Fab.com, Fast Company, and others) from where they heard about Loft Resumes. (These sites can be used later for media buys and display advertising.)\nTheir biggest competitors were people who hired designers.\nMany individuals preferred to design their own resumes.\nThey understood how customers perceived the value they received from Loft Resumes’ service—that it helped customers’ resumes stand out.\nTheir service was ideal for designers, people in creative industries, and marketing professionals.\nA short survey on Qualaroo revealed that some people felt that the prices of their services were too high.\nTests run: Redesigning the Home Page for Enhanced Messaging Clarity\nArmed with the data and above insights, the team decided that the page needed to be overhauled to improve messaging clarity around its services and benefits. The test hypothesis was that communicating the benefits of their service in a way that would make it easier for prospects to perceive would increase website sales.\nThey created a redesigned home page that looked like this:\nVWO was used to run a Split URL test between the original and the variation. The objective of the redesigned page was to align the design and message better with how prospects think about resumes. The following changes were made:\nResumes were categorized as those with photo and without photo.\nThe headline emphasized the value proposition with clarity. (The control page didn’t have any headline.) This made it easy for even new visitors to the page to understand what the site was all about.\nThe second call-to-action above-the-fold directly addressed Loft Resumes’ ideal customer profiles (marketing professionals, designers, and other people in creative industries).\nThe 6-second study was used to emphasize the challenge that with so many other candidates applying for jobs, there’s a high possibility that the prospect’s resume may not get enough attention from prospective employers. By making the users more aware of the problem, their desire to distinguish their resume from the rest was increased.\nLoft Resumes’ ability to help their customers’ resumes stand out was then shown as a solution to this problem. Users perhaps saw this service as a “need” than a frill or an optional service. This increased the perceived value of the service and narrowed down the gap with the perception of “high price.”\nThe conversion team used the popular AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) model to rewrite the copy. Words and phrases that customers had used in the survey to describe the benefits were included.\nTo add credibility to the service and make for a more compelling case, the below-the-fold section listed customer testimonials with pictures.\nConclusion: 64.8% Increase in Purchases\nThe newly-designed page beat the original, increasing purchases by 64.8%.\nHere’s the comparison image showing both the original home page and the winning variation:\nUnderstanding customers and their needs does pay. Many businesses think they know their customers well and base their marketing plans on this “knowledge.”\nA good practice is to periodically capture the voice of the customer through surveys and other avenues. Also, the feedback should not be limited to asking what customers like or dislike about your brand/service.\nThe more you let customers speak, the better insights you will have and the more effective your A/B test ideas will be. After all, the key is to make sure that your marketing messages match the thoughts of your prospects when they are thinking about buying your product and give them the required answers. Do this well, and you make a sale!",

        "raw_contents": "About Hush Blankets\nCanada-based Hush Blankets was founded in 2017 by Lior Ohayon and Aaron Spivak to improve adult sleep. Infused with deep touch pressure technology, the Hush Weighted Blanket can be used to help solve problems like stress, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), insomnia, depression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and autism.\nBefore starting Hush blankets, Lior had experience volunteering at a camp for children with special needs. This was where the inspiration for the weighted blanket came. Fast forward a few years and he decided to take the leap and design the world’s first sleep-inducing blanket for adults.\nHush Blankets have been partnering with VWO since April 2020 to optimize their website experience and conversion rates. And with the immaculate results, they hope to further this partnership.\nGoals\nHush Blankets has partnered with VWO Services to bring expertise in the process of website optimization. Delivering delightful website experiences to customers is pivotal to high conversion rates and thereby, revenue – this is the overarching philosophy behind each experiment conducted on the Hush Blankets website.\nObservations\nVWO Services identified two key pages that had both functional and usability issues.\nTest 1. Cart Page – Mobile\nThere were a lot of links on the cart page that took users to top-of-the-funnel pages. These links were receiving a lot of clicks and hence, fewer people were moving to checkout due to these distractive links.\n Some customer reviews on the cart page were negatively impacting users’ behavior. On the cart page, users’ intent is purchase oriented, and showing poor reviews can discourage them from making a purchase.\nThe cart didn’t auto-update on changing quantity which increased click effort from users.\nTest 2. Product Pages – Desktop\n As observed with funnel analysis, the drop off on the product pages was more than 70%.\n Through further visitor behavior analysis using VWO Insights, it was found that people were spending more time reading through the lengthy description and reviews.\n Clicks on ‘Add to cart’ were fewer compared to other elements of the page as observed in the heatmaps of these product pages.\nThese challenges had to be addressed immediately.\nTests run\nTest 1 – Redesign Cart Page (Mobile)\nOwing to the several issues identified on the cart page on mobile it was decided to redesign the page in its entirety and test the new version. The following changes were made on the existing cart page, which became the variation:\nThe top header hamburger menu and footer navigation links were removed to reduce distraction.\nPoor reviews were removed.\nThe functionality required to auto-update the cart when users change the quantity was built to reduce click effort.\nThe team hypothesized that a new design with the above changes would increase engagement with the checkout button and take more users to the checkout page.\nThe A/B test ran for 14 days. All traffic visiting the cart page on mobile participated in the test, with a 50-50 split between the control and the variation. The variation outperformed the control with a 10.52% uplift in visits to the checkout page. As a bonus, total checkouts (measured as visits to the Thank You page) also saw an uplift of 15.48% resulting in a net 23% uplift in revenue. This implies an estimated uplift in annual revenue of approximately USD 337,000.\nTest 2 – Redesign Product Display Page for Hush Classic (For Canada-based Desktop Users)\nOwing to the several problems on the product page on desktop, it was decided to redesign the page in entirety and test the new version. The following changes were made to the existing product page:\nThe left section with images was made sticky on scroll and the right textual section was made scrollable. This would give users access to the images which typically act as a big influencer in an online purchase decision.\nImage thumbnails were displayed vertically to the left of the main image so that images take less screen space allowing more space for the text.\nMore emphasis was placed on the interest-free installment payment option by increasing its font size.\nSelection boxes were made smaller and sized evenly so that the CTA could be pushed to the first fold of the page.\nDescriptions and reviews were arranged into an accordion to prevent users from spending more time in reading lengthy descriptions.\nAggregated product rating was included below the title in the first fold of the page to highlight it.\nThe team hypothesized that a new design (which would become the variation) with the above changes would reduce the drop-off from the product pages and entice more users to click the main CTA, sending them down the conversion funnel, therefore increasing the number of transactions.\nThe A/B test ran for 15 days with the entire desktop traffic participating in the test. Traffic was equally split between the control and the variation. The variation won the test with an observed uplift of 5.67% in conversion rate (visits to checkout page). This also led to a 33.15% uplift in checkout rate (measured as visits to the Thank You page) leading to an overall uplift in revenue of 51.32%. This implies an annual uplift of USD 720,000 in revenue.\nConclusion\nBy solving obvious problems in website experience through well-defined and well-thought-out redesigns, backed by research and analysis, Hush Blankets was able to see massive improvements in not just the key metrics of the tests, but also revenue. The variations have been made live on the website, thereby making the website more efficient, and helping Hush Blankets realize more revenue with each passing day.\nWith such early wins, the co-founder of Hush Blankets has more confidence in VWO Services. They are now looking to up their testing velocity and being more data-driven in their website optimization journey. Testing and then making changes on the website gives them more confidence in each website change, and this is followed by understanding the impact of each such change. This is something they’d definitely like to continue with in the future.\nVWO gives you the ease and confidence to validate your test ideas before you ship them.

        "raw_contents": "About BODYGUARDZ\nA company that started in 2002 with a small line of screen protectors for a few selected gadgets, BODYGUARDZ has rapidly expanded to offer a more complete range of BODYGUARDZ cases for a wide variety of mobile devices. The company’s rapid growth earned it a spot on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing companies in 2011.\nIn addition to using VWO since 2015, BODYGUARDZ has also been using VWO Services since October 2017 for all its optimization needs and has been very impressed with our product and services.\nEvery day my inbox is full of salespeople who promise revenue gains. VWO actually delivers.\nWhitney Pye\nVice President, Strategic Initiatives\nGoals\nFor each of the campaigns discussed in this success story,  each end goal was different:\nCampaign 1: Get more product registrations by users.\nCampaign 2: Optimize the accounts page to increase engagement and purchases.\nCampaign 3: Increase purchases by educating visitors on the condition of adding only one replacement product to cart in a single purchase.  \nHowever, the overall objective of pursuing these goals was to increase revenue.\nTests run\nBODYGUARDZ, in collaboration with VWO Services, ran a series of campaigns to optimize their website and improve conversions. Discussed below are various campaigns that drove a significant increase in conversions for BODYGUARDZ:\n  Campaign 1: Advantage Program Redesign\nGoal: Get more product registration from users.\nChallenge: The control had too much text and a long scrollable information section. Visitor analysis data showed that not a lot of people scrolled to the bottom. There were also multiple CTAs which took them to multiple pages which confused users.\nSolution: VWO Services redesigned the Advantage Program page for desktop and tablet users by removing the clutter, reducing redundant text and links which were confusing users to register more products. This is what variation looked like:\nResult: The test ran for 25 days, and the variation won with a relative uplift in Successful Product Registrations by 2.34% and a confidence level of 97%.\nThe same campaign ran for mobile users where the variation won with a 42.27% conversion rate against the control’s 40.15% conversion rate. This is what the winning version looked like:\nThe new Advantage Page is live on the BODYGUARDZ website.\n  Campaign 2: Redesign Account Page\nGoal: Optimize the account page to increase engagement and purchases.\nChallenge: In control, the menu options were not easily accessible. Additionally, for mobile users, the ‘Account’s menu’ disappeared on reaching any account’s page making navigation difficult. Their copy was misleading, and users had to click on several links to reach to the phone case.\nSolution: VWO Services redesigned the account page by removing redundant links, as well as adding prominent CTAs which would take users directly to relevant pages to register and view their registered products.\nResult: This is what variation looked like:\nThe campaign ran for 13 days, and the variation won with a relative uplift in Successful Screen Protector Registrations by 12.09%.\nThe same campaign ran for desktop users where the variation won with a 37.67% uplift. This is what the winning version looked like:\nCampaign 3: Redesign Eligible Replacements Page (All Devices)\nGoal: Increase purchases by educating visitors on the condition of adding only one replacement product to cart in a single purchase.\nChallenge: The control didn’t do a good job in educating users about the condition of adding only one replacement product to cart in a single purchase. It also had redundant text, and the product images were static and not adding any value.\nSolution: The restriction to purchase only a single replacement in one transaction was shown in the cart earlier. VWO Services highlighted this in the eligible replacement page whenever a user added the first product to the cart. The team also cleared all the unnecessary clutter and irrelevant text from the page.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nResult: The campaign ran for 20 days, and the variation won with a relative uplift of 2.44% in Successful Purchases. The new Eligible Replacement page is live on BODYGUARDZ website.\nConclusion\nBODYGUARDZ has been using VWO to A/B test all their optimization ideas with the help of VWO Services. Owing to this, from 2017-2018, they witnessed an uplift in several metrics that have a direct bearing on their business:\nAlthough users increased by a mere 2.51%, the revenue uplift was remarkable. Through all their testing endeavors, BODYGUARDZ has collated a lot of quantitative data on their prospective customers. Their next focus is on capturing as much qualitative data as possible with website surveys designed to understand how users interact with their website. Apart from the successful campaigns discussed above, BODYGUARDZ has several campaigns currently running, along with others, lined up to be deployed.\nThe close to 54% increment in revenue that BODYGUARDZ achieved in just 1 year stands testimony to the fact that following a structured Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) program to be paired with other marketing efforts, can go a long way in helping you make the most of your existing website traffic. VWO is delighted to have been a part of BODYGUARDZ CRO wins.\nI drive hard on ROI, and VWO delivers every single time. They bring a fresh, experienced team of eyes that consistently uncover ways to improve our online experience, and ultimately increase revenue. Our partnership with VWO has been invaluable to our growth in BODYGUARDZ.com.\nWhitney Pye\nVice President, Strategic Initiatives",

Through its proprietary technology, PayU provides state-of-the-art payment gateway solutions to online businesses. We spoke with Ravindra Govindani, Director, Product Management and Abhinav Chitre, Senior Product Manager at PayU, about how their team used VWO for reducing checkout page drop-off.\nGoals: Reducing Checkout Page Drop-off For Their Merchants\nPayU enables businesses across India to accept and manage payments online. As a payment facilitator, it is important that their checkout process be simple, intuitive, convenient, and not one that caused drop-offs for any reason.\nObservations: Lack Of Qualitative Data On Visitors’ Behavior\nBefore getting onboard with VWO, Ravindra and Abhinav would conduct experiments based on their interactions with customers and merchants in order to continually improve their checkout experience. Based on the feedback of actual users, hypotheses would get finalized to improve the checkout experience. However, they faced two critical challenges:\nWith the help of PayU’s dev team, Ravindra and Abhinav’s team used to implement A/B tests on PayU’s website at a server level. This cross-team dependency took a lot of their bandwidth, and didn’t provide them with an easy way to segment visitors based on their unique attributes such as location, platform, device type and more.\nThere was no way for Ravindra and Abhinav to gauge how visitors were behaving on their checkout page, because all they had was hard numbers like time duration and bounce rate. PayU didn’t have a qualitative understanding of what exactly was happening on the checkout page.\nThe checkout page had been resulting in a number of drop-off cases, which was a cause for concern, as it represented lost sales and revenues.\nWhat was required was a scientific way to test ideas and hypotheses related to the checkout page before deploying it.\nTests run\nVWO helped Ravindra and Abhinav in the following ways:\nAs a first step, VWO provided them with the ability to easily segment the PayU website’s checkout page visitors based on a number of parameters such as location, device type and more, as they no longer had to implement the test at a server level.\nSecond, VWO’s drag-and-drop A/B Testing Builder enabled them to drastically reduce dependence on its developers. By using VWO, the team could handle implementation of complex changes while increasing the speed of experimentation. Now, the PayU team could test more number of hypotheses per week compared to earlier.\nThird, VWO’s Visual Behavior Analytics tools such as Session Recordings and Heatmaps allowed the team to glean qualitative insights about their visitors’ behavior to be able to come up with strong hypotheses and better learnings from their test results.\nFor our checkout flow, we generally used to launch features and enhancements as per merchant’s requirements, but these were not really tested against actual consumer behavior. This is where VWO really helped us. We could test our initial hypothesis on a few visitors and then ramp it up for entire website traffic. The editor and recording feature are really amazing where you can analyze consumer behavior in stealth mode without compromising any of their personal details.\nAbhinav Chitre\nSenior Product Manager\nThe Test\nPayU’s old checkout page required customers to enter their email and phone number before completing their purchase.\nOne of these two fields was essential, as local laws mandated that a final receipt had to be shared with the individual making the purchase.\nUsing VWO Form Analytics, Ravindra’s team discovered that entering both telephone and email address was becoming a source of friction, resulting in substantial drop-offs at this stage.\nBased on this insight, they decided to A/B test if dropping the email address field would increase conversions. Here is how the two variations looked like:\nControl\nVariation\nThe results demonstrated that dropping the email field showed a statistically significant improvement of 5.8% compared to the control.\nConclusion\nBased on the A/B Test results, the email field was dropped. This concluded that a number of customers did not have an email address, even though majority of them had a telephone number, this was further confirmed when PayU contacted a number of customers and they indicated the same.\nVWO enabled improvement of the checkout process and delivered proven results through A/B testing. Since then, PayU’s goal has been to continually test and improve its checkout page and keep the user experience fluid while doing so.\nIt was really easy to conduct A/B experiments even for complex cases as we generally encounter in case of PayU’s checkout products. A double thumbs up from my side for VWO.\nAbhinav Chitre\nSenior Product Manager",

        "raw_contents": "About Ben NL\nVWO and Ben\nFounded in 1999, Ben is the personal budget challenger of the Dutch telecom service market. The company typically provides customers with two types of subscription plans: a sim-only subscription or one combined with a mobile phone. Ben is the mobile phone provider for everyone who wants to get the maximum value out of their budget.\nBen is one of VWO’s esteemed customers. It has been using our CRO services  for the last four years to constantly optimize their website, enhance customer experience, and increase conversions. We got in touch with Hans Breeuwma, one of Ben’s Conversion Specialists to know all about the test campaigns the company ran for Ben and how effective they’ve been for the brand in terms of conversion uplift.\nGoals\nBen’s primary objective is to offer the latest mobile devices to its customers with the best data and voice plans. It also aims to provide comprehensive information about its plans to the website visitors to make an informed choice.\nOf the many campaigns it runs to achieve this goal, one of them was to make the phone color palette prominently visible on the product page allowing people to select a phone color they like (black, white, blue, red, green, etc). Though a minor page element, it was directly affecting the brand’s conversion rate and overall sales figures.\nObservations\nMost people exploring Ben’s site were unaware of the fact that they could choose a phone color of their choice on the site itself in addition to other services that came along with the device. They did see the color palette on the page, but couldn’t figure out its basic function. This further led to several customers calling Ben’s customer care centers to get the color of their devices changed after placing an order with the brand.\nTests run\nTo get to the problem, Ben, along with the Dutch consultancy agency de Nieuwe Zaak, started digging deeper. As the first step, they used VWO’s visual behavior analytics tools like heatmaps, click maps, and session recordings to obtain qualitative insights about customer behavior. Further, they wanted to understand how the visitors were interacting with different page elements, mainly the color palette, and see where they were dropping off. The two companies also gathered first-hand data from their respective customer support teams to analyze the areas of problems.\nBasis all the research, the brands found that while visitors did notice and interact with the color palette placed below the product images, they still couldn’t figure out that it was a way to choose phone color. This is how the original product page looked like:\nControl Image — Placement of Color Palette below the Phone Image (Conversion Rate — 2.20%)\nTo make the color palette prominently visible on the page, Ben and de Nieuwe Zaak collectively decided to change the position of the color palette and A/B test the variations. They made the following changes:\nRemoved the color palette from below the phone image and placed it next to it to make it easy for the customers to understand the palette’s basic function.\nAlso, increased the length of their service-offering form for customers to easily choose a data and voice plan along with the device as per their requirements.  \nThis is what the variation looked like:\nVariation Image — Placement of Color Palette Adjacent to the Phone Image (Conversion Rate - 2.59%)\nConclusion\nBen ran the A/B test campaign for about two weeks on about 40,347 users to analyze how they interacted with the newly implemented changes. They found that while more people understood the function of the color palette, the number of customer calls to change device colors also dropped significantly. The test uplifted Ben’s conversions by 17.63%.",

        "raw_contents": "About Brookdale Living\nBrookdaleLiving.com offers senior citizens planning to live independently various solutions such as community living facilities, caregiving, and nursing services, and so on.\nBrookdale hired digital marketing and analytics firm Fathom to optimize its website to boost conversions. Fathom used VWO for its work.\nGoals\nThe goal of this campaign was to boost conversions from the Find a Community page.\nTests run\nBrookdale Living’s Find a Community page was truly bare-bones. There were no graphics, testimonials, or other content that would encourage visitors to convert. This is how the original page looked:\nNot surprisingly, conversions were poor.\nMatt Fieldman, Senior Account Executive at Fathom, first redesigned the page by adding content, testimonials, credibility logos, and USPs, among other elements. He then created 2 versions of the page (one with a picture and another with a video) and used VWO to conduct an A/B test to determine which would be more effective in driving conversions.\nMatt’s hypothesis was that the video version, which contained customer testimonials, would perform better than Variation 1, because it provides clear social proof.\nThe first variation with an elderly woman’s photograph looked like this:\nThe second variation had a 2-minute video that replaced the woman’s photo. The video showed many senior citizens talk about their positive experiences with Brookdale. Everything else on the page remained the same.\nHere’s the video. This is a screenshot of the video version of the page:\nThe test was run for 2 months on over 30,000 visitors.\nResult: 3.92% increase in conversions; US$100K incremental monthly revenue.\nConclusion\nWhen pitted against the original, the page with the image outperformed the video version. Variation 1 recorded a 3.92% increase in Find a Community searches (with a confidence level of 99.99%) while the video version recorded just a 0.85% increase in searches.\nMatt estimated that even the seemingly modest 3.92% increase in community searches would result in a US$106,000 additional monthly revenue.\nAs always, it is instructive to analyze why the variations did better. Even further interesting is to figure out why the conventional wisdom of using testimonial videos (which has become a venerated best practice) lost to the version with a static image.\nMatt used Fathom’s most-successful landing page template to redesign the Find a Community page. By adding relevant elements, he ensured that the redesigned page spoke to the 4 major online consumer personas expected to visit the website:\n1) Methodical consumer\nThis type of detail-oriented users try to read up every bit of information present on the page. Matt used additional explanatory content to speak to this category.\n2) Spontaneous consumer\nThis type already has the intent to purchase while visiting a website. Matt used a clear and concise search box with an arrow pointing toward the City field to speak to this customer type. He also cuts down on the number of fields – a practice that has increased conversions for many VWO customers.\n3) Humanitarian consumer\nThis type wants to know who you are and whether they can place their trust in you. To assure customers and allay their fears, Matt used testimonials and logos – 2 tried and tested elements.\nWikiJob, a UK-based VWO client, tested a customer testimonial on its product page and saw 34% increase in conversions. Similarly, another company increased conversions by over 72% by adding a trust badge.\n4) Competitive consumer\nAs the name suggests, this type wants to know why they should choose you over competitors. Bullet points that called out Brookdale’s unique selling points (USPs) were put up on the page to get their attention.\nA VWO client increased CTA click-throughs by almost 50% by changing its CTA text to a better value proposition.\nWhy the image version worked better than the video version\nIt would be fair to say that Matt wasn’t the only one surprised by the results. Given a choice between a video or a photo, most people would opt for the former. Here’s why videos are hailed as a preferred choice over static images:\nZappos’ sales went up from 6% to 30% by using video demos on product pages.\nStacks and Stacks found that those shoppers who saw videos on its product pages were 144% more likely to add to cart.\nCrazyEgg got an explainer video made which helped them generate an additional income of $21,000 per month.\nAnalyzing the “fascinating counter-intuitive nature of the result,” Matt came up with some possible reasons why the image version worked better than the video version:\n1) Brookdale was already an established brand and so the video acted as a distraction for most visitors\nAt the time of the test, Brookdale had been around for over 3 decades and was listed on Nasdaq. It was already a well-known brand and people did not need much convincing to convert on the website. Visitors had done their research and came to the website knowing what they wanted. For them, the marketing video was a distraction. Especially because the video had people talking about specifics such as “food” and the “caring nature of the staff” at the communities. It is possible that the visitors did not have these criteria in mind when they came to the site. After watching the video, they thought of “food” and “staff” as important factors in their decisions, and possibly bounced off the website to read up on what the competitors offered in these areas.\n2) Most users fall into the spontaneous customer type\nMatt felt that customers want to convert quickly and are not interested in the video. “As you can see, we were wrong. We now understand our customers better: they aren’t interested in marketing videos so much as they want to convert quickly and easily on the page”, he said.\nAt VWO, we don’t fully believe that selecting and purchasing senior citizen solutions are spontaneous decisions, which is why we don’t fully agree with this reason. But it is still a possibility to consider.\n3) Target audience has a slower Internet connection, so videos might not work for them\nAlexa indicates that Brookdale’s target audience is over-represented by women who haven’t gone to college and who browse Internet from home.\nA report on the average home internet speed in the US tells us that people who didn’t go to college are less likely to have high-speed broadband access than those who went to college.\nIt is, therefore, fair to conclude that a majority of Brookdale’s visitors did not have access to high-speed broadband connection. A slow internet speed might have led to a painful video watching experience, and hence the image version worked better.\nThanks to Tommy of ConversionXL who pointed out to us the third reason.",

So, how can asking questions be a bad thing?\nWith this thought and observation, we take you through a similar situation wherein addressing the same helped a company increase its conversions.\nGoals\nFlying Scot Marketing handed over the A/B testing duties for their website to Attacat Internet Marketing. When Attacat saw the “Details” page of the booking process, they immediately knew they had a problem, and an opportunity.\nWhen Attacat saw the “Details” page of the booking process, they immediately knew they had a problem, and an opportunity.\nTests run\nThis is how the original form looked:\nThey created a variation that removed all unnecessary form fields.\nConclusion\n45.45% increase in visitors moving to the next step and 35% increase in form submissions.

        "raw_contents": "About Digital NRG\nDigital NRG, located in Bristol, UK, is a digital marketing agency that assists businesses to excel in the digital landscape. They provide a broad range of services, including website design, search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC), conversion rate optimization (CRO), email marketing, and paid social media among other digital marketing solutions.\nAt the agency, optimization efforts for clients are spearheaded by a CRO lead and a team of executives who conduct around 50 experiments per quarter across 18 different accounts. The team fosters a culture of experimentation, viewing unsuccessful tests as an opportunity to gain insight into user behavior and improve customer journeys for their clients.\nWhy VWO\nDNRG’s choice of CRO tool became VWO due to their outstanding level of insight into customer data, sufficient quota to run multiple experiments, and efficient support system.\nVWO is competitively priced and has a good product offering. It has offered the team here at Digital NRG a great level of insight into customer behavior on our client websites and has allowed us to run a great number of tests. They also have a very responsive team, who are very helpful and take feedback on board when it is needed.\nFreya Gay\nCRO Lead at Digital NRG\nAlso, the capability to test multiple variables in parallel via multivariate testing made it a go-to product for them.\nVWO’s multivariate testing feature supports testing on a larger scale along with understanding consumer behaviors and shopping habits. It is really useful for eCommerce clients as we can identify the highest converting combination of CTAs and messages from easily digestible data.\nMercedesz Molnar\nSenior SEO Executive & Outreach Lead at Digital NRG\nGoals\nFor two of its clients, Digital NRG wanted to run conversion optimization campaigns.\nTrent’s Drains, a 24/7 drainage specialist in Bristol. The goal was to improve the conversion rate of the contact us form for the mobile version of the website.\nEnhance Insurance, a medical aesthetics insurance provider in the UK. The goal was to reduce the dead clicks and increase engagement.\nIn the following case study, we deep dive into the details of tests run for each of these clients. \nTrent’s Drains\nObservations\nThe CRO team discovered that a significant proportion of website traffic, precisely 60% of the total traffic in three months, originated from mobile devices. Surprisingly, there were no conversions on mobile, as per their Google Analytics report.\nIn order to identify the underlying cause of this issue, the team decided to analyze user behavior on the contact page by studying VWO’s session recordings (here’s how it works) on mobile devices. Additionally, they analyzed the heatmap data to determine if users were scrolling down to reach the contact form section of the landing page and if there were any dead clicks or hesitation on the form itself.\nHypothesis\nBased on the observation, the team formed a hypothesis that repositioning the contact form and modifying its plain text CTAs would result in a reduction in bounce rate and an increase in form completion.  \nTests run\nBased on the hypothesis, the CRO team at the agency performed an A/B test on the mobile version, where the control and three variations were compared. Each variation involved moving the contact form up and adding a plain-text CTA before the form. Here are details about the control and variations.\nControl – The plain text CTA is “Proudly serving customers throughout Bristol, & the South of England.”, and there are social icons below it.\nVariation 1 – The plain text CTA is the same as the control, the main heading is simplified, and social icons are removed.\nVariation 2 – The plain text CTA is “Call us on 0117 453 5994 Or use the form below”, and the heading within the contact form has been removed.\nVariation 3 – The plain text CTA contains a call icon with a contact number and a mail icon with an email id, and the main heading is simplified.\nThe A/B test ended with Variation 2 outperforming other variations and control with respect to the number of form submissions. Variation 2 included the mobile number and the option to use a contact form as a plain-text CTA. The heading within the contact form was also removed. Here is the detailed report from the VWO dashboard:\nThe team discovered that presenting the contact form above the fold and making it visible to the user as soon as the page loads, resulted in the most significant improvement in contact form submissions. By simplifying the above-the-fold messaging, the user navigation of the contact page was enhanced.\n  Enhance Insurance\nObservations\nBased on research, the CRO team discovered that the landing page had a significant number of dead clicks above the fold. Users needed a clear outline of how to engage with the company more efficiently and find out more about their policies.\nTo investigate the root cause of this issue, the team analyzed user behavior on the key landing pages of the website using VWO’s session recordings and VWO’s heatmaps. This approach helped them identify dead clicks and determine how far customers scrolled on the page, as well as assess the impact of the content located above the fold.\nHypothesis\nThe observation led to the hypothesis that inserting an additional CTA button above the fold and tailoring the button wording to suit the target audience would address dead clicks and increase CTA button engagement.\nTests run\nConsidering the hypothesis, the team generated an A/B test with control and one variation having a CTA button to the contact form above the fold. \nThe test ended with variation 1 as the winner, which had an expected conversion rate of 18.69% for the main CTA button that led to the contact form page (a 133.38 % improvement from the baseline conversion). Here is the detailed report from the VWO dashboard. \nThe team concluded that including more CTAs above the fold motivated users to contact them immediately upon landing on the website. It was particularly effective since 83.3% of users previously scrolled the page to try and find a suitable CTA.\nConclusion\nThe Conversion Rate Optimisation Agency implemented a mixture of regular client communication and VWO Insights for user behavior analysis to understand the existing user experience. It helped them to generate hypotheses and conduct A/B tests using VWO Testing for their clients. The optimization efforts resulted in significant improvements in website conversion rates and user experience. \nTake a 30-day all-inclusive free trial to explore all VWO capabilities and unleash your digital properties’ true potential.

In addition to luxurious accommodation, the hotel offers its guests great food and a large selection of fine wines. The original art adorning many of the hotel’s walls is another attraction.\nThe hotel hired Splice Marketing (now Essex SEO) to optimize the site for search and improve conversion rate of its website. Splice is a VWO client that uses VWO for testing optimization possibilities.\nGoals: Increase click-throughs to the room booking page\nThe Vineyard wanted to increase the number of visits to their room booking page.\nTests run: Make CTA More Visible to Visitors\nThis is what the original home page for The Vineyard looked like:\nThe Splice team noted that the call to action, book online was almost hidden at the end of the page, where it was hardly likely to be noticed by visitors and prospective customers.\nThe team decided to make the CTA more visible to visitors so that it would attract their attention. The hypothesis was that more visitors would click on a CTA that was prominently visible on the home page.\nThe team created a CTA button with the text Book Online (same as the original). But the CTA button was prominently placed on the page. The F-shaped eye movement pattern would ensure that visitors read “Book Online” right after they would have read “Stay with Us.” The CTA button used the same maroon color in the original design.\nThis was the variation page created and A/B tested against the control by using the VWO platform:\nConclusion: 32.12% Increase in Click-Throughs to the Room Booking Page\nNot surprisingly, the click-through rate (CTR) to the room booking page increased by 32.12%, with a near perfect 99.99% chance to beat the original.\nThe result was on expected lines because a page with a large, clearly-visible CTA button added above the fold should have always done better than the one where the CTA was near-invisible.\nHere is a comparison of the original (control) and the variation it was tested against:\nApart from the obvious outcome of boosting online bookings, the value of this A/B test also lay in the fact that it demonstrated to the hotel’s owners and managers the value of conversion rate optimization.\nThis was an important learning because from our experience at VWO, often, it is organizational resistance that comes in the way of making changes to the website that can optimize conversions.",

The organization works proudly on behalf of more than 1,100 member businesses from the area’s hospitality community and is responsible for sales and marketing efforts focused on the meetings & convention industry, domestic and international leisure travelers, travel trade and media worldwide.\nLA Tourism has been using VWO Engage’s push notification services for a long time. In a conversation with Bad Truong, a Web Developer at LA Tourism who also looks after the marketing of the organization, we asked him about his experience with VWO Engage and how our push notification tool has helped the organization in totality. Here’s what he had to say!\nGoals\nThe main objective of the organization was to look for new channels which could help them engage with their audience in a better manner and increase retention rate.\nObservations\nOne day, Bao was reading an article on Neil Patel’s blog, and he received a Web Push Notification, requesting him to subscribe to the blog. He noticed that the notification was powered by VWO Engage. Intrigued to find out more about our platform, Bao got in touch with our Sales team and within a couple of days, signed up with VWO Engage.\nBut, the main challenge here was to understand whether or not push notification would work wonders for their website.\nTests run\nRecalling their efforts, Bao told that their very first push notification was a massive hit. The company saw an astonishing click-rate of 16%. They realized that web push notification as a channel was both attention grabbing and non-invasive.\nExcited with their initial success, Bao decided to add personalization and make communication more relevant to their users. They then started using VWO Engage’s Segmentation Feature and created user buckets based on the ‘category of pages’ that people visited. This helped them understand what their users really liked reading on LA tourism’s website and enabled them to send their users targeted push notifications based on their interests.\nBut Bao and his team didn’t stop there. They decided to get really, really granular.\nThe team wrote a script to pull information from articles and landing pages that their users visited and automatically stored it in their browser cookies. The script was collecting information such as – niche categories users visited, the last article they visited, the last category they visited, how many times they visited a particular article or an article of a particular category, etc.\nWith all this information stored in the user’s cookies, they were now able to leverage VWO Engage’s segmentation-by-cookie-value feature to put users into granular segments based on their website behavior. This made it easier for them to identify a visitor’s interest in a particular topic and send notifications as per their interest.\nConclusion\nLA Tourism started seeing an astounding 8x growth in their click rate after using VWO Engage’s Audience Segmentation feature. Their users were spending more time on the website and their bounce rate reduced by 43%.\nPush Notification Tips by Bao Truong:\nWe asked Bao to share some push notification tips and here’s what he listed down:\nUse emojis.\nTuesdays and Thursdays are great to send out notifications.\nUse personalization, catchy headlines and crisp and clear messages.\nLA Tourism’s push notifications receive maximum opens between 10 am to 2 pm.\nHe further insists one the fact that one size does not fit all. Bao recommends marketers to experiment with various time slots and days to send push messages and make them as personalized as possible for best results.",

Its products are sold online as well as through stores across the US and Canada. Movexa is a joint-support supplement manufactured and sold by Vitamin Boat Corp.\nThe company engaged Source Patrol, a digital marketing agency that uses the VWO platform for website optimization work.\nGoals\nThe objective of this testing campaign was to increase online sales.\nTests run\nMovexa’s landing page originally looked like this:\nThe company wanted to increase online sales. Source Patrol was of the view that modifying the headline on the landing page would boost sales.\nThe team’s hypothesis was that adding the word “supplement” to the headline would enhance clarity of the landing page and increase sales. The conversion experts at Source Patrol were hopeful that a simple headline A/B test can have a huge impact on the conversion rate because the headline is one of the first elements that visitors see on a webpage.\nThey created a Variation Page in which the headline included the word “supplement.”\nThis is how the variation looked:\nThe variation was A/B tested against the original using the VWO platform.\nConclusion\nWith a statistical significance of 98%, the variation beat the control. Purchases increased by 89.97%.\nHere is the comparison image that summarizes the test:\nSo why did the addition of just one word make such a huge difference?\n\nThe simple answer is that the addition of the word “supplement” to the headline made it easier for visitors to instantly understand what Movexa was, even without reading the complete copy.\n\nAn excerpt from a Marketing Experiments article summarizes this perfectly: “The objective of your headline is not to sell, but to connect with your reader”.\n  The headline, which almost every visitor reads, is one of the most important elements on a page. It must be informative, descriptive, compelling and yet brief. With attention spans dipping rapidly, headline copy must be quick to grab attention and compel the reader to take the desired action. Therefore, adopting the old-school approach of using headlines on the lines of “Buy XYZ product today for an easy solution” were considered to not be effective.\nNot only must the copy be crisp, it must also be in the font and color that grab instant attention. Not giving enough emphasis to headlines is one of the most common web design mistakes.\nThe Eyetrack III study revealed that big, bold headlines capture attention more than images. Even the navigation bars and almost everything else comes after that.",

For years, The Panduro catalog was the main sales channel but in the 80s a serious focus on retail began.\nWith over 103 stores spread across 6 countries, Panduro has been the market leader in hobby materials.\nPanduro employs approx. 650 people, and has a turnover of DKK 845 million. SEC.\nThe Panduro family continues to lead and develop the Group in close cooperation with the Board of Directors and CEO Rickard Kemfors. The company is owned by Thomas Panduro, Jesper Panduro, and Peter Panduro.\nGoals\nElisabeth Isaksson is the UI/UX Designer at Panduro and typically takes care of the entire customer experience of the website. Panduro has been a legacy brand and Elisabeth realized that they needed to keep experimenting to keep up and improve the conversion rates on Panduro.com.\nSince they did not have a CRO expert within the team, they decided to opt for a tool along with services to help them with rapid testing and experimentation. While looking for CRO platforms, some of Elisabeth’s peers recommended using VWO.\nFor each of the campaigns discussed in this success story, the end goal was different:\nCampaign 1: Increase the clicks on the main CTA button in product boxes on the listing pages.\nCampaign 2: To increase user interaction with filters so as to help them land on product pages easily.\nCampaign 3: To increase the number of visitors using the search feature and landing on the search pages.\nCampaign 4: Increase clicks on the “Add to Cart” button on the product page.\nTests run\nPanduro, in collaboration with VWO Services, ran a series of campaigns to optimize their website and improve conversions. Discussed below are various campaigns that drove a significant increase in conversions for Panduro:\nCampaign 1: CTA Change on the Product Listing Pages\nObjective: Increase the clicks on the main CTA button in product boxes on the listing pages.\nObservation: In the old version, the CTA button name was KÖP (Buy) which was confusing for the user to understand the trigger i.e. taking the user to the product page or adding the product to the cart.\nHypothesis: Changing the CTA to Snabbköp (Quick Buy) and Lägg i varukorgen (Add to cart) would be better to indicate the action upon clicking. Having an additional button “View Product” below the main CTA will also add a cue for the users who want to progress to the product description page.\n  Control – CTA – KÖP (Buy)\nVariation 1 – CTA - Snabbköp (Quick Buy)\nVariation 2 – CTA - Lägg i varukorgen (Add to cart)\nResults:\nThe test ran for over 5 weeks and during this duration, the control was disabled due to low confidence levels. Variation 2 showed an uplift of 6% in the CVR for clicks on the main CTA button. The visits on revenue page also increased by 10% and thus the variation with Lägg i varukorgen (Add to cart) CTA was pushed live for 100% traffic.\nTake a free trial to know how A/B testing works.\nCampaign 2: Static Filter on Category Landing Pages | Mobile\nObjective: To increase user interaction with filters so as to help them land on product pages easily.\nObservation: Filters in the old version were not fixed at the top (below the top navigation) and thus the interaction was also low.\nHypothesis: It was expected that by bifurcating the filters into two parts i.e. Sort and category-specific filters, keeping them fixed at the top and making them more presentable and easier to the user, would increase the filter interaction and ultimately more users landing on the desired product pages.\n  Control\nVariation\nResults:\nThe test ran for 12 days and the interaction with filters increased by 53% with 100% confidence level. he variation was declared the winner and is currently being served to 100% traffic.\nCampaign 3: Search Icon Positioning\nObjective: To increase the number of visitors using the search feature and landing on the search pages.\nObservation: It was observed that the CVR for users searching on the mobile was 65% higher than without search and the search icon in the old version was not highlighted properly.\nHypothesis: By highlighting the search bar in a way that it is opened when the user lands on the website and merges with the top navigation upon scrolling down, it would stand out, thus increasing the search-and-find of the desired product.\nControl\nVariation\nResults:\nThe test ran for a week and usage of the search feature increased by 14% with 100% confidence in the variation. The number of purchases showed an overall uplift of 2.67% and thus the variation was made live for the entire audience.\nCampaign 4: Product Page Redesign | Mobile\nObjective: Increase clicks on the “Add to Cart” button on the product page.\nObservation: Through click maps, it was observed that the image was getting 60% of the total clicks on the product page.  In order to look at the product images the user had to click on each image thumbnail since there was no carousel feature. Also, the product description page was long with other product recommendations. This led to the users losing sight of the main CTA button.\nHypothesis: This is what the control looked like.\nControl\nVariation1- It was expected that by changing the image design to carousel and having static CTA button at the bottom which appears only when the CTA button on the page is not visible will optimize the clicks on the image and lead to more clicks on the main CTA button.\nVariation 1\nVariation2 – In addition to the changes in variation 1, few more changes were adopted in variation2 where savings in absolute numbers were highlighted to induce more purchases. The description was only partially shown with only few initial lines fading midway which displayed the entire content upon being clicked.\nVariation 2\nResults:\nThe test ran for 10 days and the total clicks on the “Add to Cart” button for Var 1 from both the existing and the static button was 9.78% higher than the control version and with 1.68% higher Ecomm CVR. Thus the variation 1 was declared the winner and is currently being served to 100% traffic.\nStart a free trial today to know how A/B testing works.",

IMB Bank offers a full range of banking solutions, including home and personal loans, car loans, savings and transaction accounts, term deposits, business banking, and lots more.\nAdam Ruse is the Web UI/UX Designer at IMB Bank. His role primarily includes designing the user interface and user experience of the website, as well as improving website performance through data analysis, user analysis, and experimentation.\nBack in 2017, Adam and his team started using VWO and ran a few experiments on the website to optimize its design and flow. These ideas were purely hunch-based and lacked the data needed to drive the conversion optimization process.\nOwing to this, they started looking for an A/B testing platform and came across VWO.\n“Everything about our website experimentation was ad-hoc. We started using VWO to bring a structured optimization process at IMB Bank. Our core objective was to build a data-driven experimentation culture and derive key learnings and insights that we could use to form the basis of our hypothesis and experimentations. What I particularly like about VWO is that it’s easy to set up and get started in no time.” Adam Ruse, UI/UX Designer, IMB Bank.\nGoals\nAdam heavily relies on VWO Insights to identify under-performing areas on the website. He uses all of the heatmaps, funnel analysis, form analysis, and session recordings for this. Based on the data collected, he and his team come up with testing ideas to optimize these low performing web pages and thereby drive up conversion rates:\nPersonal Loan Conversion Rate increased by 36%\nHome Loan Conversion Rate increased by 87%\nTests run\nPersonal Loan Application Form – 1st Page Optimized\nFunnel analysis showed that approximately 37% of users were dropping off the first page of their personal loan application form. Since this page had the highest drop-off rate, Adam and his team decided to focus on this page. Start your free trial today to see where your website is lacking and choose the best design for your website\nTest\nThey introduced several elements to further optimize the page:\nAdded USPs\nMentioned awards\nIncluded the time taken to complete the steps\nImproved the overall design of the form to make it easier to navigate\nIncluded clear instructions at each step to boost user clarity\nCampaign 2: Personal loan application form – Exit popup\nFunnel analysis showed that approximately 84% of users were starting the form but dropping off before completing it.\nThis clearly indicated that the intent was high – since users were starting the form filling process. This meant that IMB Bank had to come up with a solution to stop people from dropping off.\nTest\nUsing mouse-tracking, Adam and his team fired a popup box when the user’s mouse would be about to leave the screen, prompting them to save or continue the form.\nThis popup was created to get as many users to complete the form by stopping them from leaving. However, they noticed that this didn’t seem to have an impact on users completing the form, but we saw a large increase in the percentage of users saving the form.\nThey thus realized that some of the information needed to complete the form wasn’t available for some users at the time they were filling out the form, which is why the ‘save’ option turned out to be highly impactful. Users could save the form, get all the necessary information and resume the form at their own convenience.\nFurthermore, with the aim of reminding lost users to complete their form, Adam and his team tested adding a ribbon on the main page of the website. This ribbon had a button that enabled people to resume filling the form. They also plan to develop re-targeting marketing campaigns to prompt users who have saved the form to come back and complete the form to improve conversions.\nConclusion\nCampaign 1\nTest results\n9% increase in users completing the form\nPost Implementation Results (YoY)\n12% increase in users completing the form\n  Campaign 2\n  Test results\n52% increase in users successfully saved the application\n Post implementation results (YoY)\nJul-Aug 2018\nJul-Aug 2019\n5.39%\nSaved the form\n  7.33% up 37%\nSaved the form\n2%\nResumed saved form\n7% up 250%\nResumed saved form\n61%\nCompleted saved form\n85% up 39%\nCompleted saved form\nSummary\nAdam believes that Experience optimization is a continuous process. He has exciting plans to improve the website experience at IMB Bank.\nHe says, “We plan to focus on deep-diving further into consumer behavior on the website, and to better understand the way our users interact with our website. Our goal is to deliver exceptional website experiences to all our users and give them the information that they’re looking for in the most streamlined way we can.”\nThe digital experience is a growing focus for IMB Bank, as more and more people are turning to engage with their banks through a digital medium.

        "raw_contents": "About Six Pack Abs Exercises\nThis success story has some deep ramifications for anyone selling anything online. It shows how if you’re not A/B testing your prices, you could be leaving money on the table.\nSix Pack Abs Exercises (now Dr. Muscle) is a website run by Carl Juneau which provides training videos and guides on how to have a set of “rock hard abs.”\nTests run\nAt the time of the test, the page selling the abs workout looked like this for both Control and Variation:\nControl: On clicking Add To Shopping Cart, visitors were taken to the checkout page where the price was $19.95.\nVariation: Same checkout page; the only change was that now the price was $29.95.\nThe above image shows that among 1,227 visitors who saw the original pricing ($19.95), 1.1% ended up buying.\nAmong the 1,375 visitors who saw the $29.95 price, 1% ended up buying.\nSplit testing the prices by using VWO, Carl found out that both conversion rates were statistically the same, which means customers did not differentiate between the $19.95 and $29.95 price values.\nConclusion\nBy A/B testing these price values, he made an extra 61.67% revenue from the Variation compared to the Control. If he were to compare them by looking at the conversion rates from 1,000 visitors each, the $29.95 price would still make him an extra 36.48% in revenue.\nWhile it’s obvious that you should A/B test your prices to make the most revenue, what’s also important is that you’re learning the difference in how you and your customers value your offering.\nTo explain, I’ve used a bit of Economics.\nThis is the traditional price elasticity curve. As the seller’s price increases, the demand for a product decreases.\nThis is the price elasticity curve for this particular case. Notice the green line. There can be 2 reasons for that:\nThe buyers value the Abs Training products higher than was anticipated by Carl which is why increasing the price did not decrease conversion rate.\nThe buyers were indifferent to both prices and would have bought either ways.\nAs you’ll realize, both these situations were agreeable for SixPackAbsExercises.com and Carl. Now, all he has to do is A/B test his prices further to see if he’s still leaving any money on the table.",

        "raw_contents": "About Imsider\nImsider.ru is a Russian company that helps new ventures start their own online stores.\nThe company used VWO for their A/B testing needs.\nGoals\nThe objective was to increase the number of leads generated through completed forms.\nTests run\nImsider.ru’s original landing page had a no-frills design. It had a contact form that visitors were asked to fill and submit to subscribe to a mailing list. Visitors who submitted the form would receive a link to download a free e-book on opening an e-store.\nA relatively small number of visitors subscribed to the mailing list. As there was no other high-impact element above the fold, Imsider decided to perform an A/B test to see if changing the headline would make a difference. The English translation of the original headline was “A step-by-step plan for opening your internet store.”\n\nThis is how the landing page looked.\nImsider created a variation in which the headline translated to “Open your internet store in one evening.”\n\nHere’s what the variation looked like:\nConclusion\nImsider’s hypothesis proved right. The variation won, generating 9.52% more leads than the original landing page. The statistical significance of the test was an almost-perfect 99.99%.\nWhen asked why he thought the variation headline worked better, Andrey Kryukov from Imsider said: “We thought that the phrase ‘in one evening’ will be more attractive to customers who want to open their first internet store than just ‘step-by-step plan’. People usually think that opening an internet store and starting your internet business is hard and long work.”\nIt is useful to try and understand why the variation worked better than the original. We believe the variation headline was better on three counts:\n\n1) Promised time-bound benefit\nThe new headline made a clear promise that customers could potentially set up their online stores in “one evening.” For entrepreneurs looking to start their online business, being able to hit the ground running in a day would be sheer magic.\n\nVisitors might be tempted to compare what they could otherwise do in “one evening.” By putting a value to “one evening,” the new headline utilizes the relationship between time saved and money spent that has been so well enunciated by behavioral economist Dan Ariely.\n\n2) Conveys ease of task\nFor prospects reading the new headline, opening an internet store suddenly sounded much less daunting. The phrase “in one evening” served to reduce the inertia in the their minds.\n\n3) Commands action\nThe variation headline falls under the “command category” of Copyblogger’s eight headline categories. The Command Headline boldly tells prospects what they need to do. Bly recommends that the first word should be a strong verb demanding action- and that is exactly what the word “Open” is in the variation headline. In addition to being a strong action word, it is instructive, persuasive, and conveys to the reader the benefit of the action. The confidence in the statement conveys to the customers that they are dealing with people who know what they are talking about, so the customers are in safe hands.",

The in-house experts answer your questions, providing you with all the information you need, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player. They guide you through casino rankings to help you avoid unreliable platforms, ensuring you play safely.\nThey meticulously assess each online casino for trustworthiness, and those that meet their criteria earn a spot on their site. As a leader in the field, they stay updated on the latest news, casino bonuses, and flash offers.\nWhy VWO\nAfter saying farewell to Google Optimize it was crucial for us to find a new simple solution for our A/B Tests. And it seems like we have found in VWO the perfect replacement : almost as easy to start your first test, but then way more potential beyond this.\nPaul Lenglet\nMarketing Operation Manager\nGoals\nIn today’s digital landscape, how users interact on a website holds great importance for search engine algorithms, particularly Google, as it directly impacts rankings. Hence, the Critique Jeu team wanted to improve the user journey and on-site navigation.\nThe question was, could they do it by optimizing the in-text hyperlinks? They believed that experimenting with colors, background, underlining, and bold formatting could improve inter-page navigation for visitors and potentially improve the website’s ranking on search engines.\nObservations\nFirstly, by checking external sources and looking at other sites in Critiquejeu’s network, the team found the advice of ‘contrast is key’ prevalent. They also deduced that some colors might be more effective in catching visitors’s attention. \nAnother important aspect of this test was realizing that people still remember the classic blue underlined hyperlink. Even though it’s a bit old-fashioned now, it’s widely used internationally. They aimed to leverage this shared memory effect to improve inter-page navigation on their website.\n  Hypothesis\nThe team hypothesized that changing the color of the anchor text in the copy to a unique shade that stands out from the common color scheme on the website would increase clicks on internal links, such as PayPal.\nBy doing so, they also revived the use of blue underlined hyperlinks in the copy, which they thought would help improve the said metric. \nTests run\nIn the control version of the payment method page, the anchor text in the body copy is in red, fitting well with the color scheme of the page. However, in the variation, the color of the anchor text was changed to blue. \nHere are the control and variation images of the A/B test: \nThe test was run for a little over a month and the variation emerged as the winner improving the number of clicks on internal links by 22.81%. \nConclusion\nSometimes, it’s surprising to see an idea that you thought might not fit into an overarching picture work well without causing any major disruptions. In this test, the team might have initially believed that using a color slightly different from the established color scheme would look out of place. \nHowever, they went ahead and tested it to let the data speak for itself.\nThey reintroduced the practice of using blue hyperlinks as the test proved they worked, and although different, they were not completely in contrast to their brand identity. \nWith VWO, setting up the test was easy because of the user-friendly and intuitive visual editor. So, although the team was used to Google Optimize, running this test was no major feat, not to mention the incredible results that showed up within a month. As a Google Optimize user, if you haven’t migrated to VWO, you can do so right away. Start with our free testing plan or take a free trial to explore all capabilities. ",

They also specialize in prescription sports safety eyewear for a variety of sports. The company’s main goal is to provide customers with increased safety while working or enjoying their favorite activities. \nBetween December 2019 and May 2020, the Safety Gear Pro website registered a total visit of 100K+ of which the United States accounts for more than 70%, and 70%+ of their traffic is organically driven through Google searches. Their high-quality products, affordable rates, and dedication to safety have also helped Safety Gear Pro establish a loyal customer base.\nSafety Gear Pro has been using VWO Services since 2019 for all its experience optimization needs. We got in touch with Parvez Panjwani, Partner at Safety Gear Pro to learn about their recent A/B test successes, one for mobile and one for desktop.\nGoals\nWhile the metrics tracked in the test discussed here were category page visits, visits to Thank You page, and Revenue, the main objective of both the tests was to increase transactions for Safety Gear Pro.\nObservations\nFor the two tests discussed here, the challenges faced were unique:\nTest 1 Challenge\nSafety Gear Pro’s home page is amongst the most visited pages, especially by new users. Even when users landed on a description or category page, they visited the home page for more information about the company and otherwise. However, data showed that the homepage was experiencing a high bounce rate and exit rate.\nTest 2 Challenge\nData showed that the site search was amongst those elements on the website that provided high conversions. However, the percentage of visitors using the site search was considerably low.\nTests run\nTest 1 – Homepage First Fold Redesign (Desktop)\nObjective: Increasing the number of transactions\nObservation: Homepage being the highest traffic page, it’s high bounce and exit rates called for a deeper look. On further investigation, the team guessed that they were not offering anything on the first fold that added any value. \nHypothesis: Adding more information about Safety Gear Pro’s services, products, and offerings on the first fold of the homepage would reduce visitors’ cognitive load and result in increased transactions. \nSolution: To add more information on the first fold of the homepage, the team at Safety Gear Pro made a number of changes to it. They added:\nA hero banner of a user using the product\nA Call-to-Action button leading to the most visited category page\nA “Most Popular Categories” section within the first fold to increase the engagement on the home page and moving more people to popular category pages\nPointers on the service quality, safety, and guarantee to increase buyer motivation and trust\nCopy that resonated directly with their target audience segment – the blue-collared, price-sensitive segment\nHere are the control and variation:\nResult: The test was run for 100% of the desktop traffic with an equal distribution between control and variation and ran for 20 days. The variation won with a 10.86% increase in visits to categories page and a 3.28% increase in Thank You page visits.\nTake a free trial for A/B testing to see for yourself.\nWe have seen great improvements in our conversion rates on pages where we have conducted testing using VWO.\nParvez Panjwani\nFounder\nTest 2 – Site Search Bar Redesign (Mobile)\nObjective: Increasing the number of transactions\nObservation: Data showed that the site search was amongst those elements on the website that provided high conversions. However, the percentage of visitors using the site search was considerably low.\nHypothesis: increasing the site search bar’s usage and improving the experience would result in increased purchases.\nSolution: To test the aforementioned hypothesis, the size of the site search bar was increased so it could be highlighted more and was easily discoverable by the visitors. This test, with the variation as the winner, resulted in an 8.33% increase in purchases. \nTo further optimize it, to deliver improved user experience by reducing their cognitive load, and to increase their eCommerce conversion rate, the Safety Gear Pro team decided to do a second round of testing on the same site search bar. As opposed to the control, which only showed suggestions when a user started typing, the variation shows pre-populated search suggestions with top searches and top categories as keywords whenever users tap on the search bar. Search suggestions were created on the basis of keywords that were being used more frequently by users on the website using site search along with the highest traffic category pages with high page value. \nResults: The test was run for 100% of the website traffic with an equal distribution between control and variation. It ran for 9 days on all the pages with the site search bar. The variation won with a 20.40% Thank You page visits.\nWe had several hypotheses going into our engagement and VWO helped us test those and they brought a good deal of their own after studying our user behavior.\nParvez Panjwani\nFounder\nConclusion\nThrough VWO Services powered testing, Safety Gear Pro was able to improve user experience and key metrics significantly. The new experiences delivered to the users resulted in an overall conversion rate improvement of 11.84%. Safety Gear Pro not only always tests as a rule, but they also follow an iterative approach of testing to find their website’s most optimized version with superior experience delivered.

They operate on a “marketplace model” where interested sellers can list their established and profitable websites for sale.\nGoals\nThe core objective for undertaking the optimization exercise was to improve the click-through rate of the Call-to-Action (CTA) button.\nTests run\nThe original website had a sidebar on the right which was used to collect leads and also guide people to the Create my Account CTA section. This is what the original page looked like:\nThe Empire Flippers team first ran A/B tests to identify an image that would boost conversion. They then hypothesized that changing the original CTA text “Join Us” to something more attention-grabbing and compelling would boost their clickthrough rate. A variation was thereby created and this is what it looked like:\nThe variation was created with the changed text on the green CTA button, as shown above.\nThe A/B test was set up by using VWO. It was run on multiple pages of the website by using VWO’s Advanced mode.\nConclusion\nThe variation won and recorded a 33.1% higher conversion rate (3.84% compared to the 2.88% conversion rate for the control). The results had a confidence level of 96%, meaning that the variation can be expected to beat the original 96 times out of 100.\nThis test shows how sometimes even seemingly trivial changes can affect website performances significantly. So why did this simple CTA text change work so well?\nOn the Internet, visitors need a good enough reason to take an action. The original page was not clear about what was being offered. Compared with the original Join Us, the revised CTA text Make Money-Flipping Websites provides visitors with a more clear answer to the critical question “What’s in it for me?”\nThe new CTA text was clearly more compelling.",

The ease of digging into customer insights and running tests with VWO’s drag-and-drop editor was truly seamless.\nRuben ten Brinke\nMarketing Operations Coordinator\nGoals\nAs a SaaS player that primarily caters to SMEs, Teamleader’s main objective was to increase the number of free trial sign-ups generated on a recurrent basis.

With this objective in mind, Ruben decided to sign up for VWO and optimize the free trial sign-up pages on all websites of Teamleader.\nObservations\nBefore choosing VWO to optimize their websites, Ruben and his team had limited capabilities in terms of running A/B test on their website pages. Here are some of the challenges they faced:\nThey could not A/B test Teamleader’s main website based on the Drupal CMS, and could only run very basic A/B tests on the landing pages they built using a third-party landing page software.\nEven after switching landing page softwares, they could not A/B test at the speed and scale they wanted to because of limitations to the capabilities of the software. The test reports did not provide them with enough data to generate any actionable insights.\nSince Teamleader operates websites in different languages based on the region, they had to set-up tests individually for each one of them.\nWhat Ruben and his team needed was a simple way for them to run A/B tests on Teamleader’s websites, at the velocity and complexity which could help them ramp up their conversion optimization efforts.\nTests run\nAfter signing up for VWO, Ruben and his team were able to kickstart the A/B Testing efforts for Teamleader’s main website. Ruben personally loved the reporting and analytics that VWO provided them for their A/B tests. In addition, they could now run A/B tests easily on their websites across all regions. With VWO, all of the operational and technical capability challenges faced by the Teamleader team were solved.\nNow, to meet the objective of increasing the number of free trial sign-ups, Ruben and his team decided to go after the lowest hanging fruit, that is, Teamleader’s free trial sign-up page. They ran a couple of tests, which showed an improvement in conversions ranging from 9% to 16%. Here’s a look at some of them:\nTest 1: Adding “No Credit Card Required” Improved Conversions by 12.5%\nIn the first test, Ruben decided to test the hypothesis of reducing friction by adding information about non-requirement of a credit card to sign up for a free trial, on their Netherlands and Belgium websites. The hypothesis proved to be true.\nControl\nVariation\nFor Teamleader’s Netherlands website, the variation achieved a conversion rate of 54.8% compared to 48.7% for control. For Teamleader’s Belgium website, the variation achieved a conversion rate of 38.6% compared to 33% for control.\nTest 2: Optimizing Forms Improved Conversions by 9.3%\nIn another test, Ruben and his team decided to optimize Teamleader’s free trial sign-up form by testing two versions of it. For the variation, they made modifications to the CTA, font size, number of form fields, and also added the asterix sign for compulsory form fields on Teamleader’s Belgium website.\nControl\nVariation\nThe variation resulted in a winner with a 37.5% conversion rate, compared to 34.3% for the control.\nTest 3: Introducing Social Proof Increased Conversions by 12%\nFor this test, Ruben decided to test the original free trial sign-up page against two variations, one with information about Teamleader’s product offering and the other with customer logos.\nControl\nVariation A\nVariation B\nThe variation with customer logos, Variation B, produced an uplift in the conversion rate from 36% to 40.3% for Teamleader’s Netherlands website.\nTest 4: Introducing Icons in Form Fields Improved Conversions by 13.1%\nIn this test, Ruben and his team introduced icons for various form fields on the free trial sign-up page to test the impact, if any, on the conversions for Teamleader’s main website.\nControl\nVariation\nThe variation with icons produced conversion rate of 37.11, as compared to 32.84 for the original one.\nConclusion\nAfter finding their initial success, Ruben’s journey with VWO unraveled the true potential of A/B testing and optimization for him and his team. Next, they plan to scale their conversion optimization efforts to a larger scale and wouldn’t mind exploring the VWO Experimentation platform for the same.\nVWO allowed us to refocus on our Experience Optimization with a fresh lens. The connectedness of the platform made it very easy for me and my team to ramp up our efforts.\nRuben ten Brinke\nMarketing Operations Coordinator",

        "raw_contents": "About Contorion\nContorion, with more than 300,000 products and 500 top brands, is building a treasure trove for all things maintenance, repair and operations (MRO). \nDealing with both B2B and B2C clientele, Contorion is digitizing the experience for every craftsperson out there in Europe, in a manner not seen before. And while doing so, they are also staying on the pulse of CRO and experimentation. \nIn the past, despite working with multiple CRO platforms (including the likes of Optimizely), the team wasn’t able to find the right mix of tools to scale experimentation. But this changed when they moved to VWO in 2017. \nLeading this move was Marc Sandifer, then, the cornerstone of the Contorion CRO team. From then, Marc has not just built a CRO ‘testing circle’ but has also been able to architect the holistic approach of experimentation at Contorion with VWO. While inculcating experimentation culture through VWO has been a rewarding experience, the challenges that propelled the move throw light on how CRO trumps large scale business problems.\nMarc Sandifer, Senior Product Manager (CRO/UX) at Contorion GmbH\nObservations\n1. Getting first-hand consumer insights in an unconventional industry!\nContorion’s target audience ranges from institutional manufacturers to home improvement enthusiasts. Because of this vast diversity, relying on industry practices or advice from online gurus to understand consumers is not an option for them.\nWe sell tools to craftsmen, a lot of our users are accessing us from within their workshops, from older Windows desktops, sometimes even Windows XP! So yes we have some unique challenges there because the user behavior is so diverse and not in line with all the best practices out there – Marc\n2. Building a collaborative experimentation culture \nContorion was looking for a fluid setup that would not only increase the testing frequency but also add on experimentation cohesion across the board, having sync across teams and involving people from across the organization.\nContorion didn’t just want to do CRO, but do it the right way, where people from outside product management and IT (the driving departments for experimentation at Contorion) were also involved in experiments and were a part of quantitative testing across the website.\nTests run\nUnderstanding the vastness of consumer diversity \nThe first step was understanding the magnitude of consumer persona that Contorion caters to. VWO Insights helped immensely in understanding the target audience – how they behave on the website, what their motivations are and what elements cause them to drop-off the website for Contorion. Session recordings, heatmaps, and funnel analysis massively helped Marc understand the nuanced target audience better.\n  Finding the right way to involve everyone in the CRO process\nI really like that we can use VWO across every department. It’s pretty easy to use and straightforward. Test results are easy to read also for people who don’t have testing experience. Testing experience with VWO was quite intuitive for all. UX of the tool was quite accessible as well.\nMarc Sandifer\nSenior Product Manager\nMarc realized that to develop a better strategy for experimentation, there was a need to create a culture of voluntary involvement across the organization to share their consumer learnings and participate in experimentation. This was also needed in order to achieve business goals and drivers that were far more consumer-focused.\nThis cross-team contribution exercise was immensely helped by VWO because of it’s simple and easy to understand UI and its overarching CRO Platform. It wasn’t long before Contorion was instilled with CRO best practices, right from the test setup to goal setting and finally deriving business metrics.\n“The VWO tool in itself was very conducive to collaboration. Persistent guidance and brainstorming by the VWO account management team was instrumental in tying up loose ends.” – Marc\nTesting Circle\nContorion has now smoothly transitioned from a one-man CRO job to what they call ‘Testing Circle’ – a fluid setup with organic participation from across teams in all things experimentation. The move has been able to deliver synergetic involvement, remove bottlenecks, and build a collaborative setup that was earlier a gap. This testing circle has designers, developers, UX professionals, user testers, product managers all coming together and ideating hypotheses on a bi-weekly basis.\n“The testing circle helped us move away from a top-down approach to a more collaborative model. We have been able to remove disconnection across the design, IT, product, and experimentation teams. A Waterfall model has been created” – Marc\n  After building the Testing Circle, Contorion has been able to work towards tying the loose-ends of their consumer experience in a more strategic way. Below are few tests that have reaped the rewards of a collaborative experimentation culture.\n\nTest 1 – Site-Wide Scrolling Banner\nRationale: Based on inspiration analysis and understanding what their competitors were doing right, Contorion wanted to set up a site wide scroll banner.\nHypothesis: A site-wide scrolling banner for special promotions would increase traffic on the promotional landing pages. \nImplementation: Doing an A/B test via VWO Testing was the best way forward to analyze multiple iterations.\n– Control : No site-wide element is displayed during the promotional period.\n– Variation 1: A thin static banner is displayed site-wide. Clicking the banner sends the user to the promotional landing page.\n– Variation 2: A thin scrolling banner is displayed site-wide. It scrolls down with the user and always remains at the top of the page. Clicking the banner sends the user to the promotional landing page.\n  Results: Both Variations beat the control version, Variation 2 (scrolling banner) performed best, and more than tripled the traffic to Contorion’s promotional landing page. This had a significant impact on the overall funnel, improving their conversion rate (CR) during promotional periods by >5%.\n    Test 2 – Product Details Page (PDP) Width Adjustment & Recommendation Placement \nObservation: Through VWO Insights’ session recordings, the team learned that some of their trust elements(reviews, etc) were more distracting than beneficial to the overall user experience.\nHypothesis: Removing trust elements across the website and using the space to increase the size of product information while pulling product recommendations higher up on the product detail pages will improve the add-to-cart click rate and recommendation click rate.\nImplementation: The team ran a Split URL test using VWO to compare the conversion of the existing design with the new design of the PDP\n– Control: The regular PDP at the time was displayed.\n– Variation: Trust elements below the buy box were removed, space was filled by stretching the product information and pulling the recommendations higher up on the page.\n  Results: The add-to-cart click rate increased by 2.4%, the recommendation click rate by a whopping 60%. The impact on the overall CR was clearly visible. \n    Test 3 – Streamlined Search Result Page Product Tiles\nRationale: VWO Insights helped the team notice that the click rates of add-to-cart and quantity elements on Search Result and Category Pages were very low, users preferred to visit the PDPs before making a purchase decision.\nHypothesis: Removing various purchase-related elements like so and so from the search result and category pages would increase the CTR to PDPs\nImplementation:\n– Control: The Search Result and Category Pages contained all purchase-related elements.\n– Variation: The team removed all purchase-related elements from the Search Result Pages, only leaving the product images, titles, and prices.\n  Results: The click-through rate (from the search results page to the product detail page) increased by 2.3%. Thanks to the segmentation options in VWO, the team at Contorion was able to determine that the uplift on mobile devices (3.3%) was even higher than on Desktop devices (1.84%). \nConclusion\nThe conversion rate optimization program at Contorion has been reaching new heights with VWO at its side. Now the aim is to not only do quantitative testing but also go full throttle on qualitative and far more exploratory testing, powered by VWO.\nMarc and the team have often toyed with the idea of building an in-house experimentation platform. But with the success of Testing Circle, he feels it’s easier to build a culture of experimentation in an organization when you have a specialized third-party platform such as VWO. Start your free trial with VWO A/B testing to know more.\n  What’s next for Contorion and VWO\nGoing forward, the focus for Contorion is to increase the velocity of testing and incorporate new elements in their already robust arsenal of experimentation. With plans of expanding to more territories and encountering an even more diverse customer base, VWO would be at the helm of Contorion’s continuous efforts to experiment and build their own best practices rather than just rely on secondary research.\n   ",

        "raw_contents": "About Vendio\nVendio, an Alibaba.com company, specializes in providing free e-Commerce stores to its merchants. They have special landing pages for free store sign-up. They used VWO for testing their webpages.\nGoals\nThe main objective was to increase sign-ups on one of the special landing pages.\nTests run\nTheir original landing page (control) combined marketing content and registration fields in an attempt to reduce the number of clicks for a successful registration.\nThis is how it looked:\nOriginal Landing Page (with the embedded sign-up form)\nNote that it uses the so-called “best-practice” of embedding the sign-up form in the landing page itself. They had long been using the layout of the original page; because as a best practice, they presumed that reducing the number of clicks for registration increased the conversion rate. Although the page was performing relatively well, they wanted to make sure the included registration fields weren’t too aggressive or limiting in any manner.\nSo, the variation that they tested had somewhat similar imagery and content, but the page didn’t include any registration fields and had slightly different styling. Clicking the Signup Now button took the visitor to a page with sign-up form.\nIn other words, Vendio added an extra step in their conversion funnel. Not a smart move, huh?\nThis is how the variation looked like:\nVariation – 60% Increase in Sign-Ups\nConclusion\nGuess what? The page without the registration fields performed better – much better – to the tune of a 60% increase in conversions!\nHere is what Vendio had to say about the results:\nBest practices are NOT always true! It’s still hard to believe, but the numbers don’t lie.\nIf you do changes on your website or landing pages without A/B testing them, you are actually flying in the dark. Another lesson here is that it is worth testing radically different ideas – which, on the first glance, may appear not-so-smart (like removing the sign-up form from the landing page).\nOn their part, Vendio gave a positive testimonial for VWO:\nVWO was extraordinarily valuable. It was far easier to use than other solutions (some of which we couldn’t even get to work properly after implementation). Without VWO we would still be missing out on all those registrations, and we are continuing to see great and other surprising results with VWO.\nA/B testing can have a real impact on lead generation.

        "raw_contents": "About TheHOTH\nTheHOTH is a white label SEO service company. They provide link building services for agencies and SEO resellers. They use VWO tools for website optimization.\nGoals: Increase Leads (free sign-ups)\nThe company took to testing in order to increase the number of account sign-ups from the home page.\nTests run\nThe original home page of TheHOTH website had a video and a sign-up form (above the fold), customer logos, testimonials as well as other necessary and good-to-have elements. The site was getting a decent amount of traffic on their home page, but conversions were quite low. Changes to their headline and other elements of the page did not make a significant difference.\nThis what the original home page looked like:\nA study of their historical sign-ups revealed that most of their sign-ups came from from referrals, word-of-mouth, and direct search. This data point meant that most visitors to their website were already familiar with the brand and the company’s services. This triggered the hypothesis that that eliminating everything from the home page except the sign-up form would increase conversion of visitors to account sign-ups.\nTo test this hypothesis, the company created a variation page and set up a split URL test with VWO.\nThis is what the variation page with nothing other than the sign-up form looked:\nTraffic was split across the 2 versions of the home page—the original and the minimalist home page with only the sign-up form. The test ran for 30 days and close to 3,000 visitors became a part of the test.\nResult: The minimalist home page increased account sign-ups for TheHOTH from a low 1.39% to 13.13%.\nConclusion\nSo why did the minimalist home page work for TheHOTH?\nBased on how visitors find a website, traffic to a website can be divided into 5 categories: direct, search, social, referral, and paid. In case of TheHOTH website, most visitors were from the direct or referral categories. Hence, they already had some knowledge of the company. This was also true for traffic originating from the social channels.A large portion of their search traffic also came from branded keywords (see data from Alexa below). Hence, visitors to the website already had a certain level of trust in the brand. It is thus possible that many visitors signed up for an account to learn more about the offering, as no information about the service was available on the landing page\nThe clutter-free design focused solely on one aspect—signing up for an account.\nThe original home page had 2 CTAs above the fold. It has also been proven in an eye-tracking study by Moz that visual media attracts attention instantly. Going by the F-shape reading pattern of web visitors, it is likely that the video took attention away from the form.\n[Read this post on how you can guide visitors’ eye path to the conversion goal.\nThe sign-up form on the original page is in the dark shade of red and is on the top of a red background, which prevents it from getting much attention. The second CTA to sign up for an account at the end of the page also doesn’t have any contrast compared to the red tile in the background.\nRead more about how color psychology affects conversions.\nA minimalist home page poses challenges too:\nQuality of leads\nWhile the number of leads is important, so too is their quality. A major challenge with having such a design is that many people who sign up to understand the product or service and may later realize that it is not a good fit for them. Or the company would need to invest time and effort in educating such “leads” about the company and its services. TheHOTH addressed this by adding more information after sign-up, reaching out to customers through phone and email, and implementing an educational auto-responder.\nAdditional pressure on sales\nLow-quality leads put additional pressure on the sales team, which had a hard time differentiating between motivated leads willing to buy and and those who had signed up just to understand the offering and were not close to making a purchase decision.\nLow trust\nThe variation page had nothing on it except the sign-up form. Visitors who did not know about the brand or were unaware of its services had no way of finding out more information. This could lead to a situation of low trust that can impede sign-ups.\nIt would be interesting to see the results of a variation that has a testimonial along with the sign-up form on the left (something like what is shown below).",

Its photo printing services include printing on clothing, corporate gifts, cutlery, and Christmas-themed gifts such as cards, posters, and calendars.\nTo push more sales through its website, Paul at Drukwerkdeal decided to optimize the company’s product pages. He chose VWO for the job, given its ease of use and breadth of capabilities.\nGoals\nThe main objective of this optimization campaign was to increase sales by changing cross-selling elements on product pages.\nTests run\nPaul reviewed a number of product pages on the original website and realized that the cross-selling messages were not convincing. He feared that this was doing them more harm than good.\nThis is how one of their product pages looked:\nNotice the links in green under the product description that were intended to cross-sell.\nPaul decided to remove the cross-selling links and run an A/B test against the original to see what effect this change would have on their sales. Since this was going to be a big move, he decided to first test the change on only a few product categories. To implement this, he used pattern matching to include some URLs on which they wanted to test.\nThe variation product page after removing the cross-selling links looked like this:\nMore than 14,000 visitors became a part of this test that ran for 2 weeks. The metrics on which this test was judged were average order value (AOV), number of products purchased per order, add-to-cart conversions, and transactions.\nConclusion\nAll test data was pushed into Google Analytics (GA) with a single click while setting up the test on VWO. This allowed Paul to obtain holistic insights on a range of parameters apart from absolute conversions.\nThe variation page recorded 5.6% improvement in the number of online orders completed. The test data also helped Paul to conclude that the variation page performed better for both the new and returning visitors and all traffic sources, particularly for organic and direct.\nTo quote Paul, “We do a reasonable amount of testing on our website and try to be very curious about all the things we add to our site. I had a sense that it would distract visitors and would have a negative impact on conversions. Now we know that it did.”\nBolstered by this success, Drukwerkdeal implemented the variation on all its product pages.",

        "raw_contents": "About Zalora\nFounded in 2012 by Rocket Internet, Zalora is the fastest growing online fashion retailer in Asia. Competing in the 600+ million people APAC online fashion market worth approximately US$63.5 billion, Zalora aims to become the region’s leading online fashion destination.\nVWO got in touch with Liang Jian Tan and Wai Teng Yong, who were then part of the regional onsite marketing team at Zalora. The purpose was to learn all about a successful checkout optimization test they ran by using the VWO platform, with the help of the VWO Services team.\nGoals\nBased on their research, which we will discuss later in this success story, Zalora’s aim here was to increase the number of checkouts by optimizing the product page to highlight its rewarding features such as free returns and free delivery. Changes were made across all product pages of both their English and Chinese websites.\nAs a firm that has always taken pride in being data-driven, Zalora was convinced of the need to optimize its conversion funnel.\n“We’ve always been very data-driven. Zalora began about four years ago and we have been A/B testing using VWO for three years. As an early stage company, we are heavily focused on new customer acquisition, and using data to optimize the site experience is super important for us.”\nLiang Jian Tan\nAssociate Director, Regional Marketing Analytics\nObservations\nIn the giant APAC online fashion market, competitive pricing with assured quality, accessibility, and ease of transaction are what determines the fate of any company. Zalora’s customer service team contended that the customers were not aware of their free returns policy due to poor visibility of the feature on the website.\n  Tests run\nIn general, the Zalora Experience Revolution Loop (ZERL) framework drives the process of onsite optimization at Zalora. Here is how it works:\nThe first step of optimization is research, which results in the formulation of  hypotheses for testing, followed by prioritization of test ideas.\nTesting is started, leading to the analysis of results.\nThe team then loops in the Product Management team to make final changes to the page(s).\nBased on the feedback from Zalora’s customer service, the team at Zalora came up with ideas that could increase the visibility of their free returns policy. VWO Services team was responsible for understanding Zalora’s needs and helping them set up the optimization campaign. They were also responsible for implementing the ideas generated by ZERL.\n[Control] This is what the original product page for Zalora looked like:\n  Notice how the rewarding delivery details are hidden under the See more section in the original page.\n[Variation 1] Shift the “Free” keyword from the right to the left-most position: Wai Teng Yong and Liang Jian Tan wanted to bring uniformity in Zalora’s call to action buttons. They suggested that for variation 1, “Delivery above $150” should be changed to “Free Delivery above $150” and “30 Days Return” be changed to “Free 30 Days Return.” Zalora also wanted to test the CTA “Yes” on their product pages.\n  [Variation 2] Add “& Free Returns” copy next to the price tag: Zalora wanted to explore whether adding “Free returns” right after the price would affect conversions across certain products that had the element “30-day return” shown on the page.\nTo implement changes corresponding to the first variation, the VWO consultant created a campaign to be run on all of Zalora’s product pages across its website. The changes in the text were made by using VWO Visual Editor. This is what variation 1 looked like:\nFor the second variation, the VWO consultant created a draft campaign by adding the code to the “Add JavaScript/CSS operation.” The campaign was run across all of its product pages. This is what variation 2 looked like:\nAfter listening to the team at Zalora and understanding their needs, VWO Services developed a campaign by using VWO’s Code Editor. The implementation of the test was quite complex, as changes were not to be applied on all product pages. For example, there were certain products on which “30-day return” was not applicable, changes were not applicable on certain products that were on sale, and so on. This required the services team to create a complex coding structure to check all such deliverables, go through each product category, and then apply changes. On many such pages, the disclaimer copy read “Item is non-refundable and non-returnable,” as shown below:\nThe VWO consultant ran a campaign with the control and 2 variations on all the product pages. Visual as well as textual changes were made and tested across multiple browsers and screen resolutions to make sure that the variations ran as smoothly as the control.\n“Working with VWO Professional Services was a very smooth process. After we provided the test hypothesis and desired setup, they had the test ready to run in just one day. We found their technical expertise especially valuable- this enabled us to expedite the setup process and saved us many hours that would have been spent trying to resolve technical challenges. Additionally, the quick response time and reliable customer service provided is commendable. We are glad to have VWO as a partner, thank you VWO!”\nWai Teng Yong\nRegional Marketing Analyst\nResult: Variation 1 emerged as the winner, improving checkouts by 12.3%. Wai Teng Yong attributed the success of this variation to 2 factors:\nFollowing the natural reading order, visitors tend to process content from left to right. Putting the most important information on the left helped customers note these crucial contents first.\nBringing too much attention to the price can be an early deterrent for potential buyers.\nConclusion\nSince its inception, Zalora has been A/B testing by using VWO to acquire new customers, optimize site experience, and so on. VWO Services with their quick response and technical expertise provided added incentive for them to continue using VWO.\nA/B test elements of your checkout page and convert prospects into paying customers with VWO.

I’m looking forward to using it. The customer support team is very responsive and quick, most of our problems get solved after a few email exchanges with them. So far the experience has been great!”\nLiang Jian Tan\nAssociate Director, Regional Marketing Analytics",

On the upper right corner of the website’s homepage was a link to the ticket e-shop. The link text said “Køb Billet”, which translates to “Buy Ticket” in English.\nThis is what the original homepage looked like:\nJesper Sorensen, a consultant with Klean, took on the task of optimizing Arhus Teater’s website. As a first step, he decided to demonstrate to the decision makers at Aarhus Teater how VWO works and how easily tests could be setup on it- and how powerful the tests can be to help make decisions around changing elements of the website.\nJesper simply changed the CTA link text from “Køb Billet” to “Køb Billetter” (“Buy Ticket” was changed to “Buy Tickets”). Apart from using the plural, nothing else was changed.\nHere’s how the variation looked:\nThe test was run on over 10,000 visitors for 20 days.\nConclusion\nThe results were beyond anyone’s imagination. The tiny change on the CTA link text from the singular “Buy Ticket” to the plural “Buy Tickets” increased Aarhus’ sales by 20%. The variation had a 98% chance to beat the original- which meant that the jump was not accidental or otherwise statistically insignificant.\nJesper was delighted with the results, which helped him prove to decision makers at Arhus the benefits of the optimization process and the power of A/B tests to identify specific opportunities that would deliver superior outcomes. “This test was meant to be a test case/showcase for the decision-makers at Aarhus Theatre, and we’re naturally very happy that it turned out the way it did” said Jesper.\n“I wish I could say the test was part of a cunning plan- but it was not”, Jesper said. So why was such a small change able to deliver such massive results?\nThere are two main reasons why it worked:\n1) ‘Buy Tickets’ is more clear\nPeople seldom go out for movies or plays alone. They go out as couples or larger groups. To them, the message of “Buy Ticket” may have been slightly misleading because they may have thought they could buy only one ticket at a time. The text “Buy Tickets” clearly conveyed that they could buy multiple tickets at once. Also, as Jesper pointed out, “Tickets signal that you can buy tickets for several shows”.\n2) The element tested was crucial\n“I chose the link because it has direct effect on the sales. I set up the test at the very meeting with the decision makers as part of my demonstration. That said, I have done some conversion work on a number of websites and I usually have a good eye for spotting elements to test” said Jesper. And that’s precisely the point. Although a seemingly small change, it had the potential to make a big difference as it could directly impact sales.",

Rarely do we come across a customer who shows us how conversion rate optimization has ramifications for the business at large.\nThat’s what makes today’s success story super special; a simple change leading to higher sales and revenues, which enabled the business to eliminate a cost center.\nMoho Internet Concepts is a company based in Groningen, The Netherlands. Moho operates in a competitive market where constantly improving conversion rates is key to get better results and enlarge market share.\nGoals\nThe Online Marketing Manager for Moho Internet Concepts wanted a banner above the product images to take lesser space while conveying more information. The test revolved around this change and the desired results.\nTests run\nThe primary web store of Moho is Horloges.nl, which they use to sell watches from various manufacturers.\nTheir landing page for the Casio G-SHOCK line of watches contained a 780px x 72px banner, just above the product images.\nControl\nThe text says:\nOfficial G-SHOCK dealer\nFree shipping\nTomorrow at home (Simple way of saying “delivered the next day,” thanks to Thomas of Webdesigner.nl for the translation)\nThe hypothesis behind the change was that greater trust could be established in the minds of the visitors if they were promised a 2-year guarantee along with Official Dealer, instead of only the Official Dealer status.\nHere’s the 780px x 52px variation tested.\nVariation\nThis variation says:\nFree shipping – Familiar with PostNL (Means “reliably with PostNL”, thanks to Thomas for the translation)\nTomorrow at home – Order before 16:00\nOfficial Dealer – 2-year guarantee on watches\nConclusion\nResults\nOn a 95% significance scale, the variation generated 41% more turnover on visitors that visited the G-SHOCK page (in a testing period of 2 months)\nAverage order value improved by 6%\nRamifications for the Business\nHorloges.nl used the increased revenue to cover the cost of shipping the watches, meaning that shipping became “free” and stopped being a cost center for the business.\nInsights Generated\nHorloges.nl has taken this further by showing to customers that they are an “Official Dealer” and further strengthened their credentials by offering a 2 year guarantee. This indicates that it’s very important for customers to trust you and you should work to increase that in all possible ways.\nOther Interesting Facts about This Test\nRick Sportel of Moho Internet Concepts reports that he used VWO to create and set up this test in only 30 minutes, changing only about 20 characters of HTML code.\nAlso, for the first month, the variation didn’t show much increase, but Rick decided to wait for statistical significance and the current result was achieved after 2 months of testing.",

        "raw_contents": "About Eastpak\nEastern Canvas Products, Inc. started manufacturing durable gear and safety equipment for the U.S. Army nearly 40 years ago. Today, the Eastpak® brand not only packs quality, style, and convenience in its backpacks and shoulder bags, but also brings innovation to travel with its creations like wheeled suitcases. \nEastpak joined hands with VWO in 2019 and has since focused on building an experimentation culture that moves the needle across revenue, conversion, and user experience metrics in a fast-moving fashion world. \nThe fashion industry and experimentation\nFashion has been continuously evolving, more so in the last two years with Covid-19. As an industry that relies heavily on customer self-expression to define success, customer experience has become a key component for the industry. And with digital becoming the only normal, experimentation is the soul food that a thriving fashion business needs now. Continuously improving the online customer experience is paramount. Retail subject matter experts at VWO resonate with the fact that persistent user-experience experimentation and improvement by way of personalization, contextual on-page content, and immediacy is the only way forward.\nObservations\nWe sat down with Ilse Normington, UX and Web analyst at Eastpak, to understand the experimentation process and needs of the company. In her 3 years at the organization, she has grown from focusing on sales and conversions to solely managing experimentation across the 12 European brand websites and becoming the consumers’ voice within the organization.\nBack in 2019, Ilse realized the need for a dedicated A/B Testing platform and led Eastpak to move to VWO in order to sort the challenges they were facing, which were as follows:\nLack of experimentation ownership and business impact\nThe experimentation culture at the organization was mostly outsourced and under-utilized. While there were tests being run, the velocity was missing, as was deriving business applications of these experiments. \nThe earlier A/B Testing platform that we had was limiting, in the sense, we couldn’t get deep into the experimentation culture, we had no control over the process, the analysis wasn’t as actionable as we would like, leaving us thinking if we should go live with a test or not.\nIlse Normington\nUX and Web analyst\nUnderstanding the changing consumer needs and resonating with them\nWith the changing times, there were a lot of new learnings within the Eastpak team which were earlier marked as ‘gut-feel’. Quantifying them and delving deeper into the user journey was something that was needed to deliver a far more contextual user experience.\nDisjointed systems\nLike any other global organization, Eastpak was also swimming in the deep waters of multiple systems, tools, and platforms to integrate into their artillery. Without synergies, it was not only affecting turnaround time but also affecting efficiencies and ultimately the revenue. Add to that the fact that Ilse and her team dealt with 12 European websites across 8 languages at any given point in time. This meant that experience needed to be deployed instantaneously, and hyper-localized across the continent.\nTests run: A connected platform\nFor us, VWO is not just an A/B testing tool, but a comprehensive website utility tool.\nIlse Normington\nUX and Web analyst\nIn order to drive growth and solve the specific problems that Ilse and the team were facing, they zeroed down on VWO since it not only helped with A/B testing but was also able to analyze and optimize user journeys end-to-end. Add to that VWO’s consultancy wing – VWO Services, they were able to source some of the industry’s best CRO resources driving the A/B testing culture within the organization, all that with the right amount of hand-holding.\nAnd the results are there to see. Earlier, tests were run only on Eastpak’s UK, France, and Italy websites, that too at a limited pace. Now with VWO, not only has the frequency of tests improved, but they are also able to run these across all the websites in Europe with assistance from VWO Services. Take a free trial with VWO to improve your testing velocity.\nWith the right support system in the shape of VWO Insights and robust reporting, Eastpak UI & UX team has not just been able to double down on the user insights that they want to test out but have also been able to make business decisions that have led to major website improvements. \nSometimes it can take months (based on the priority and bandwidth of internal teams) to take things live on the website, If we didn’t have VWO Web Rollouts, we would have lost a lot of revenue potentially in the past year or so.\nIlse Normington\nUX and Web analyst\nWith VWO Web Rollouts, the team has been able to tie loose ends on their websites faster and without much dependency on the overworked front-end development team, considering these changes run across different languages and require immediate action. \nIn totality, experimentation has come full circle at the organization. There are synergies at scale, multiple ‘task force’ teams (consisting of Merchandisers, Product Managers, Marketing & UI/UX folks) working on specific experimentation projects.\nExperimentation has gone from something that some of us used to do on the side, to something that has become the core of what we do, and other departments know and value what we do, and contribute to it as well!\nIlse Normington\nUX and Web analyst\nBesides these macro wins for Eastpak, we also discussed few experiments that Ilse’s team were proud of, and in general, can provide inspiration for other experimenters out there:\nStickied Filter Bar\nRationale: VWO Insights showed that only 5% of mobile visitors interacted with the filter bar on Product Landing Pages. The team wanted to ensure customers only see the most relevant product from the vast product range which is why it was important that they notice and use filters.\nHypothesis: By redesigning the mobile filter bar, giving it clear and consistent labels, and making it sticky to the top of the screen would lead to increased filter usage and conversions.\nResults: There was an improvement in the interaction with the filters by 106% compared to the Control group. Business-wise, there was a 7% increase in click-through rate, because customers were now more easily able to find relevant products.\nStreamlined Check-out Journey\nRationale: VWO Services team suggested that there was an unnecessary extra step within the checkout journey that showed a quick view popup on the mobile shopping cart, and this was causing customer dropout. \nHypothesis: By removing the extra step and sending customers straight to the shopping cart when clicking the cart icon, there can be an increase in conversion rates.\nResults: There was an increase in the click-through rate by 14%, i.e. removing one additional step made it quicker and easier for customers to make a purchase and improved their checkout experience.\nConclusion\nWith the increased appetite to experiment across all Eastpak websites, Ilse and the team are now considering rehauling the overall product landing structure. With inputs from the VWO Services team, they are moving to a user-centric layout that is far more immersive (including gamification and interaction elements) and customer-centric.\nYou can read more on optimizing your website for customer experience here.

        "raw_contents": "About Acuity Scheduling\nFounded in 2006, Acuity Scheduling provides online appointment scheduling services. Targeted mainly at small businesses and individuals, its customers include life coaches, yoga instructors, salons and thousands of other businesses.\nThe company uses VWO for testing optimization opportunities.\nGoals: Increasing Conversions (sign-ups for paid plans)\nBased on the freemium business model, Acuity Scheduling offered 3 pricing plans:\nUnlimited Free Trial Account (with limited feature access)\nProfessional (Single User) Plan: $10/month\nPremium (Multi-User) Plan: $19/month\nThe original landing page had a call-to-action button that directed users to the unlimited free trial account by default. The idea was to give customers a feel of the software and prompt them to upgrade to the paid plan within the app by making them realize the value of features that were available only to paid users.\nLike every other online service provider, Acuity too wanted to improve conversions for their paid sign-up accounts. Acuity found that many users who had signed up for a free account later deleted them. A survey of such users revealed that they expected more features in the free version of the software. Despite being made aware that those services were available in the paid plans, they chose to delete their accounts.\nTests run: Offering a Free, Limited Period Full-Feature Plan\nBased on the findings of the survey, the Acuity Scheduling team hypothesized that directing visitors to a 14-day free trial of their Professional plan directly instead of sending them to the unlimited free trial account (with limited features) would increase sign-ups to their mid-level Professional ($10/month) plan.\nThis was a huge change for the team, especially because the site had organic leads based on articles pointing to the site’s unlimited free trial plan. Directing users to a paid plan meant a dealing with a different set of user expectations; the risk of overall sign-ups dropping was real.\nAcuity Scheduling used VWO to set up and launch the test within a few minutes. In the new model, visitors signing up for the 14-day trial of the professional plan only had to enter their credit card information to continue using the software, instead of having to visit the account settings tab to upgrade their plan, as was the case earlier.\nConclusion: 268.14% Increase in Sign-Ups for Paid Accounts\nThe variation increased the sign-ups for paid Professional accounts by 268.14% with a 99.99% chance to beat the original.\nAlthough the primary goal was to track sign-ups for the paid version of the Professional plan, like any smart marketer who understands the need to track the impact of one test on multiple goals, the Acuity Scheduling team also tracked sign-ups for their Premium plan ($19/month) as well. The VWO tool made it easy to track multiple goals.\nAlthough the result was not statistically significant, the test also showed a 77.78% improvement in sign-ups for the company’s Premium plans too.\nThe Acuity Scheduling team made this change based on survey feedback, so it was perhaps reasonable to expect that sign-ups would improve. But another way to explain the boost in sign-ups might be this—even in the limited period of the free trial, users got hooked to the product and its features. They saw value in the service, and so were willing to pay for it after the free trial period.\nOn the other hand, users who started with the free-for-life plan got used to not paying for the service. This overrode the fact that certain features were not available to them. Rather than paying for these features, they preferred instead to delete their accounts instead of upgrading.\nThis may be why offering a 14-day free trial of the Professional plan worked better for Acuity Scheduling than the original, limited feature, free-for-life plan.",

        "raw_contents": "About Cocohanee\nFounded in 2019 by Jinuk Lee, Cocohanee is an eCommerce website that specializes in clothing and related items for kids. Whether it’s a sleepover, a party, or the first day at school, Cocohanee caters to indulge all that a child needs for their next look.\nBefore working with VWO Services, Cocohanee had no history of experimentation for optimization. They were on a look-out for:\nA robust platform that would enable them to run advanced tests without the need to code extensively\nA single platform to track all the experiment metrics\nA team that would actively assist in ideation as well as implementation\nThe VWO Experience Optimization Platform along with VWO Services checked-out all the boxes and since early 2020, Cocohanee has been using VWO for all its optimization needs. We got in touch with Jinuk Lee, Founder at Cocohanee, to learn all about 2 of their many recent A/B testing wins. Let’s dive in!\nGoals\nThe main objective of the Cocohanee website is to drive sales. The team’s aim to deliver a great experience on the website which leads to sales is paramount. Identifying breakages and improving them through continuous and robust testing is the way-of-life for the team at Cocohanee. We explore two of the recent testing successes here:\nTest 1 Objective: Increasing add-to-cart clicks and overall conversion.\nTest 2 Objective: Increasing visits to the listing pages.\nTests run\nTest 1 – Adding USPs on the product page\nObjective: Increasing add-to-cart clicks and overall conversion.\nObservation: The team at Cocohanee noticed that their return policy, as well as shipping cost, were not displayed anywhere on the website. This may have caused many potential buyers to abandon.\nHypothesis: The team hypothesized that displaying Cocohanee’s return policy and shipping cost below the page’s 2 main CTAs would nudge users towards completing a purchase.\nSolution: To achieve the goal of increasing add-to-cart clicks and overall conversions, the proposed change of adding Cocohanee’s return policy and shipping charges below the main CTAs were made, to be tested against the control. Below is a comparison image between the control and variation for your reference:\nResults: The test ran for 14 days with 100% of Cocohanee’s traffic being split equally between the control and variation. The variation won with a 16% increase in their Add-to-Cart CTA and a 17% increase in revenue. \nTest  2 – Redesigning the Hamburger Menu (Mobile)\nObjective: Increasing visits to the listing pages.\nObservation: Many visitors were clicking on the hamburger menu icon, but their engagement with the menu itself was very low. This was because the sub-categories on the hamburger menu were not shown to the visitors directly. They had to click on a category to view its sub-categories.\nHypothesis: Showing the sub-categories to the visitors directly will lead more visitors to the listing pages.\nSolution: To run the test, the proposed change of showing the sub-categories directly when they open the hamburger menu was made into a variation to be tested against the control. Here is a comparison image of the two:\nResults: The test ran for 22 days with 100% of Cocohanee’s traffic being split equally between the control and variation. The variation won with a 4% uplift in listing pages’ visits. Additionally, the test resulted in a 28% uplift in eCommerce conversion rate, a 29% increase in transactions, and a 17% increase in AOV (Average Order Value).\nPrior to working with VWO, we designed our website through intuition, not facts. VWO provided a data-driven approach to analyze user behavior and helped us achieve our target metrics. We now work by data, not intuition. Our CRO consultant from VWO has been a trooper to prioritize the problems to tackle and was 24/7 available.\nJinuk Lee\nFounder\nConclusion\nThe 2 successful tests proved that even simple UI changes go a long way to improve user experience and conversions. In the first case, simply adding the return policy and shipping charges in the checkout page and in the second case, making the sub-categories directly accessible to the visitors resulted in reduced visitors’ cognitive load and contributed greatly to increasing overall transactions for Cocohanee by 40% in just 3 months. \nThe tests discussed in this success story were amongst the many successful ones Cocohanee has conducted so far and which have contributed to the increased transactions. With VWO Services on board, the team has been testing every change, analyzing visitor behavior, and improving their website experience, one page after another.\nTake a free trial with VWO to build and deliver great experiences on your website too!",

        "raw_contents": "About Springest\nSmall changes can have a big impact on a company’s bottom line. Length, structure, position, or design of forms can have tremendous influence on conversions.\nThis success story is about an A/B test run by Springest, which is an independent comparison website for training programmes and courses. L&D providers place their learning products here, allowing you to view, compare, and find your ideal course or mode of education.\nEduhub used to be their brand name in The Netherlands.\nTheir business model involves providing brochures to the visitors who request for them (when they find a suitable course provider). Brochure is free, but the visitors need to fill a lot of information in the form to access it.\nThey used VWO to create another version of the form and to test it against the current version.\nGoals\nThe aim of the Springest team was to increase form completions on the brochure information request form.\nTests run\nThe Springest team used VWO to create an alternate version of the form and see if it increased the form completion rate.\nHere’s how their original form looked like:\nOriginal brochure request form\nThey tested one variation of this form, with some parts changed. They removed the intro text and logo and added social proof to the sidebar—quotes from users and logos from well-known Dutch brands. They also removed the asterisk for required fields and changed it to “optional” text behind fields that are optional.\nHere’s how the variation looked like:\nVariation (generated additional €50,000 for Springest)\nConclusion\nThe variation resulted in 5.21% improvement in form completion, with 97% certainty (statistical significance) based on over 2,500 conversions. The team was partly surprised, because the form itself hardly changed. Their changes were mostly about taking away possible obstructions or doubts in the user’s mind and it seems the social proof removed doubt for at least some of the visitors.\nAlthough 5% doesn’t look like much, it adds directly to their bottom-line; they estimate this change to be worth about €50,000 this year alone. Isn’t that a great ROI for doing such a simple A/B test?\nEven though Springest are extremely happy about results of this test, they didn’t want to stop improving and they already have extensive plans for follow-up tests. For this form, they want to split it in two parts and also test it with less fields. As soon as they launch a complete new layout of their website, they plan on A/B testing every part of it.",

        "raw_contents": "About Hubstaff\nHubstaff was born out of a desire to help distributed teams work more efficiently. Founded in 2012, Hubstaff offers time tracking and project management software for companies with growing remote, in-office, and field teams. \nIts three flagship products (Hubstaff Time, Hubstaff Desk, and Hubstaff Field) give teams smarter time tracking, location-based automation, proof of work features, invoicing, payroll, and more. The Hubstaff suite is designed as a complete workforce management platform, including an Agile PM tool called Hubstaff Tasks and a remote work talent platform called Hubstaff Talent.  \nToday, co-founders Dave Nevogt and Jared Brown lead Hubstaff’s team of more than 90 people across the world as a remote-first (and only) company. \nWe spoke with Hubstaff Marketing Manager, Peter Gratale, to hear about how the company uses VWO. Peter is one of the many folks at Hubstaff who work with A/B tests since 2019. Dave Nevogt, one of the Co-Founders of Hubstaff, has been using VWO since 2015. \nThe testing and experimentation journey at Hubstaff has greatly evolved since 2015. In the beginning, the team was mainly testing solo elements such as headlines or buttons. In recent times, they’ve run both small and advanced, high-risk tests on their websites. The Hubstaff homepage redesign test is one such high-risk example that we will discuss in detail.\nGoals\nDave is a true believer in the power of experimentation because of the business impact it can have. At any time, at least five different experiments are running on the Hubstaff website. Running these tests for strategic changes to the marketing and product experience gives the team confidence in any change.\nHubstaff’s former homepage (the control) had the same design with only small modifications. This time, Dave and his team decided to go for a complete overhaul. They wanted Hubstaff’s growth and expanded positioning front-and-center on the website. They also hypothesized that showcasing the most recent and relevant features would likely drive more conversions, for example, visitor-to-trial and trial-to-paid conversions.\nObservations\nThe thought process\nFor Hubstaff, traffic, trials, and revenue are key performance indicators of marketing efforts. \nWhen hundreds of thousands of visitors are involved, dropping a couple of percentage points means thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Thus, the team puts a lot of thought into every single test. \nTraffic to the Hubstaff homepage leads directly to trials and paid plans, so SEO best practices were a priority in order to draw the right kind of organic traffic. The homepage update had to ensure an optimal conversion rate through a smart hierarchy of copy and visuals that highlighted all the right features.\nHomepage redesign\nAmong all pages of their website, Hubstaff’s homepage draws the largest number of visits, so Dave and his team did not want to risk losing conversions and traffic. The biggest fear was that they would set up the test and launch it, but conversions wouldn’t happen. Though only 50% of the audience would see the variation, any dips in conversions could have a trickle effect. \nThey also wanted to ensure that the results from the test justified the time and effort that the team invested in creating the new design.\nIf this test proved successful, the team would then roll out the new design to the remainder of the site. In other words, the future of the marketing site rested on making sure this test was created and tracked accurately.\nWhen testing such a critical page’s redesign, the team at Hubstaff had to keep an eye on multiple factors, including tracking the on-page conversion rate and using heatmaps to view visitor behavior.\nTests run\nTest: Homepage redesign Split URL Test\nHubstaff followed a thorough process for creating and designing pages on the website. Following that, the redesigned page launched as a Split URL test. This is what the old homepage (the control) looked like:\nDue to the potential impact of this test, the team tracked multiple metrics through VWO:\nVisitor-to-trial conversion: This metric would confirm whether the new page is driving more visitors to start a trial.\nHero form submission: Number of visitors submitting their emails on the homepage by filling out a form and clicking “Create Account” vs. clicking on the “Free 14-day trial” CTA button.\nOn-page engagement: The total number of clicks to indicate the level of visitor engagement with the homepage.\nPricing page views: The number of visitors clicking through to the pricing page.\nFull funnel journey: Tracking visitors who converted from free trials to paid customers further down the funnel. This metric was tracked to understand that if conversion to paid customers was lower, was it due to the new homepage design or an experience in the app itself? Within the app, the experience is the same for both the homepage versions.\nResult\nMore than 10 team members were involved in the whole process, from ideation to design to execution. It took three months for the test to be ready, with design taking the most time. The test ran for three months. A total of 259k visitors were a part of it (across the two pages that were running).\nThe variation won with a 49% increase in sign-ups. Here are the final results:\nVisitor-to-trial conversion: This was one of the key metrics that the team at Hubstaff was chasing, and it saw a 49% increase. \nHero form submission: There was a 34% increase in visitors entering their emails on the homepage. \nOn-page engagement: The number of clicks decreased by 6%. However, connecting that to the sign-up data suggested that the new page was performing better in sign-ups, reducing the number of clicks.\nPricing page views: There was a 3% decrease in pricing page views.\nFull funnel journey: VWO reporting showed a 7% drop in free trial-to-paid conversions. But as mentioned above, considering that the in-app experience was the same for both homepage versions, this drop could not be attributed to the new design alone. The team also conducted more in-depth research using additional analytics tools, which corroborated that paid subscriptions were not affected. \nVWO was essential in understanding which landing pages and variants were performing and which were not. In our early days, this really helped us understand the types of copy our audience was responding to and helped shape our marketing efforts ever since.\nDave Nevogt\nCo-founder & CMO\nConclusion\nWith the homepage test successfully wrapped up, the Hubstaff team will continue to A/B test smaller pieces of the homepage, such as copy. (VWO’s powerful visual editor is backed by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo and offers effective copy alternatives for existing text on your page. Take a free trial to see how it works!) \nNow that we’ve switched to the new design, it’s going to all be about optimizing from here.\nPeter Gratale\nMarketing Manager\nToday, at any given time, the team at Hubstaff runs at least 5 tests with an average of 3 tests per month. Through regular and rigorous experimentation like this, folks at Hubstaff know that they are always on the growth path. VWO makes A/B testing easy for you and helps you improve your testing velocity.

        "raw_contents": "About VenueSphere\nVenueSphere is a London-based online third-party referral business that helps individuals and companies find the perfect venue for parties, meetings, conferences and other events. Their service is completely free for visitors.\nGoals\nBen from VenueSphere believed that their original homepage was fairly broad – it didn’t perform brilliantly in getting conversions because it was not focused. So he wanted to get people’s attention and get them to read more about what VenusSphere does. VenueSphere selected VWO with the aim of improving lead generation by optimizing the form on its homepage.\nTests run\nTo capture leads, VenueSphere had a simple form above the fold on their home page. The headline Looking for a venue in London? just above the form, described the service provided. The original version of the page also had a subheadline that read Call us or fill in a form to speak to a dedicated venue coordinator. This is how it originally looked on their home page:\nBen decided to play around with the subheadline in an attempt to increase the number of leads. He believed that a more dynamic and attention-grabbing headline would help generate more leads.\nHe created a variation with the new subheadline Stop right now! Call us or fill in the form and we’ll do the hard work for you for free. Using the VWO platform, this variation was tested against the original version (the control). The goal being tracked was the number of times the thank-you page popped up (which was shown to people who filled the contact form and submitted it). It was, therefore, a good indicator of the number of leads from the form.\nThis was how the home page looked with the new subheadline:\nClose to 1,200 visitors became a part of this test, and the variation emerged as the winner.\nConclusion\nThe new subheadline resulted in a healthy 69% increase in leads. Having integrated VWO with Google Analytics, Ben was able to access and analyze a lot more data to gain more insights. He said “I was also able to see that our phone conversions were better with the variation, as was time on site, pages per visit and bounce rate.”\nHere’s a comparison image showing the control and variation:\nTo understand why the variation generated 69% more leads, it is useful to deconstruct the new subheadline into 3 parts:\nPart 1: “Stop right now! Call us or fill in the form”\nAfter reading the headline, this part of the subheadline clearly directs visitors to what they need to do next. The “Stop right now!” phrase might sound a tad abrupt or even rude, but it definitely got visitors’ attention. Quoting Ben, “I was concerned that it might be too forceful, that it might put people off, but that didn’t seem to be the case. I think that there is a strong case for saying that users want to be told what to do in certain situations”.\nPart 2: “and we’ll do the hard work”\nThis phrase assures the user that VenueSphere takes complete responsibility for helping them find the perfect venue. It also signals to the visitors that the task of finding the right venue is a lot of hard work, but VenueSphere would do it for them.\nPart 3: “for free.”\nThe magic word “free” lets visitors know that all they have to do is to fill out the form and that the company (VenueSphere) will help them find the perfect venue at absolutely no cost.\nBased on this test, it is hard to say exactly which part of the changed subheadline motivated visitors the most: the first, where they were directed to what-next; the second bit which told them that the company would take complete responsibility for the task; or the last, that it was all for free!\nAdditional testing (or using Multivariate Testing) can certainly improve the probability of ascertaining which element visitors valued the most.",

        "raw_contents": "About Showpo.\nShowpo is an online fashion retailer with young women as its primary target customers. It is a pure-play women’s fashion company with a vision “to be her go to place to shop”. Showpo’s annual revenue for the last year was over $30 million, and a little more than a third of its sales occurred internationally.\nBecause of its excellent optimization efforts and structured CRO process, Showpo has been winning the Online Retailer Industry ORIAS award for Best Site Optimization and Design for 2 years now. We got in touch with Mark Baartse, CMO of Showpo, and Felicity Ieraci, Showpo’s UX Designer to learn about the multiple tests that VWO Services helped them and their team conduct on the company’s website and product pages.\nGoals\nWith the aim of marrying their qualitative approach with VWO’s quantitative approach, Showpo started using VWO early this year. The objective was to create a better customer experience, and in the process, optimize conversion rate and LTV.\nWorking with VWO has been great. They provide a great level of quality from concept to execution and analysis.  \nFelicity Leraci\nUX/UI Specialist\nObservations\nShowpo was facing internal resource constraints, especially data resource constraints.\nAnother challenge was that to tackle its conversion problems, Showpo had hired an agency. The results the agency was producing were dissatisfactory, and it also proved to be expensive.\nTests run\nMark and his team in collaboration with VWO Services ran a series of campaigns to optimize Showpo’s website and improve conversions. While a few of them are still running, here are the ones that reached completion and generated positive results:\n1. Increasing revenue by 6.09% through increased upselling\nGoal: Based on the hypothesis that adding a free shipping strip on the product pages would result in increased upselling, the goal set was to increase revenue.\nSolution: Both Showpo and VWO teams decided to add a “Free Shipping” strip on the product pages and created 2 variations—one with a pop-up and another without it. This campaign was run for mobile users as well so that Showpo’s entire customer base could be tested.\nThis is what the control looked like:\nIn both the variations, the free shipping strip not only notified the buyers about the free shipping option but also calculated and shared the balance amount required for the buyer to be eligible for free shipping. This is what the strip looked like:\nThis is what variation 1 (without the pop-up) looked like:\nThis is what variation 2 (with the pop-up) looked like:\nResult: In this campaign, variation 1, which did not have the pop-up, emerged as the winner with a higher visitor count as well as more instances of upselling, leading to higher revenue generation than both the control and variation 2. The campaign was run for 44 days and generated $22,080 additional revenue, that is,  6.09% uplift in revenue over the control.\nIn variation 2, the buyers were not able to see the strip clearly because of the pop-up window. As a result, they directly went to the cart page without adding more products, leading to limited growth. Now, variation 1 is served to all their users.\nThe same campaign was run for the desktop and tablet users for the same number of days. Here too, variation 1 emerged as the winner with a higher visitor count as well as higher revenue generation than the control or variation 2. Variation 1 generated $13,834 higher revenue, that is, a 5.22% uplift in revenue over the control. Variation 1 is now served to all Showpo users.\n2. Newsletter Subscription (all devices)\nGoal: Showpo’s largest source of email subscribers are Join Newsletter reminders. Therefore, the goal of the campaign was to increase newsletter sign-ups on the sign-in and checkout pages. On both pages, users can sign up for the Showpo newsletter by selecting the required check box.\nSolution: The Services team changed the copy of the check box and wanted to test whether this change affects the number of user sign-ups for the newsletter. Two variations were created with different copies to be tested against the control.\nThe copy in the Control read “Join our Newsletter.” This is what the control looked like:\nVariation 1: “We wouldn’t say EXCLUSIVE if we didn’t mean it! Join our newsletter to find out.” This is what variation 1 looked like:\nVariation 2: “Lead the fashion pack – sign up to our mailing list for exclusive access to special discounts and the newest styles!”. This is what variation 2 looked like:\nResult: After running the test, variation 1 showed a 175.52% increase over the control in newsletter signup through the sign-in page and a 146.78% increase over the control in newsletter signup through the checkout page.\nWith VWO’s visual editor, you can generate text alternatives for existing copy on your page. You can also A/B test these alternatives to check what works best. Take a free trial to start using this AI-based feature!\n3. Decluttering the product information section (Desktop and Tablet)\nGoal: Increasing the number of purchases, thereby generating a higher revenue over the control\nSolution: This is what the control looked like:\nAs per valuable insights from Mark and his team, the VWO Services team highlighted the pricing, discount, and product review stars and also enhanced the visibility of Add to Cart CTA. The purpose was to declutter the product information section. This campaign ran for 27 days from July 12–August 7, 2018, and was directed only to desktop and tablet users. This is what the variation looked like:\nResult: The campaign ended with the variation yielding positive results. The conversion rate was specifically high in the case of new users. With the variation, for new visitors, Showpo was able to get 1.33% higher purchases, and then generate around $19k of higher revenue.\nConclusion\nFollowing a structured CRO process and utilizing the capabilities that VWO offers, Showpo  optimized major components of its website, resulting in an overall optimized funnel. With help from the VWO Services team, Mark was able to upsell more products, increase newsletter subscriptions and also improve the overall product information section. All of this led to significant increase in conversion and revenue generation as shown above. Showpo also has multiple campaigns planned as the next steps for ongoing improvements. Building a CRO roadmap and implementing it becomes easy with VWO.

Mindenegyben Blog’s reader base typically comprise of folks belonging to all age groups who enjoy leisure reading.\nMindenegyben Blog is one of VWO Engage’s esteemed customers. It has been using VWO Engage’s services to build smart marketing strategies for customer acquisition and retention, and increase overall website engagement. We got in touch with Scott McBayer, one of Mindenegyben Blog’s Marketing Managers to understand all about the campaigns the company has run and how effective they’ve been in terms of customer engagement uplift.\nGoals\nMindenegyben Blog primary objective was to convert its existing traffic into loyal readers. It also aimed to decode the formula behind push notifications frequency to increase their repeat traffic.   \nObservations\nInitially, Mindenegyben Blog used to collect subscriber data through a two-step verification process on their website. In this process, the readers would have to click ‘Allow’ twice to successfully subscribe and start receiving push notifications from the brand.\nHowever, while scrolling through the blog’s Google Analytics reports, the brand realized that although they were driving hundreds of new visitors every day to their website, the repeat traffic on the site was very low.\nTests run\nIn an attempt to help Mindenegyben Blog achieve its objectives, VWO Engage’s Customer Success Team noticed the brand that their current process was causing a significant leak of potential subscribers, since most of them did not complete the two-step opt-in process. The team immediately recommended Scott to change its two-step opt-in verification process to a single-step opt-in process.\nScott and his team made necessary amendments and saw that the mere change enhanced their subscription rate exponentially. Mindenegyben Blog increased its daily average subscribers from 300 to 2000!\nWith VWO Engage’s dashboard, they could also track delivery rates and click-rates for all the push campaigns, making it easier for the brand to identify which content pieces were working the best with their audience base.\nIn addition to this, the brand typically promotes news-related content to its subscribers as it’s one section which generally gets them the highest click-throughs. To identify how frequently they should be sending push notifications, the company ran multiple A/B tests and experimented with various time slots to send out push messages.\nConclusion\nScott and his team realized that sending three push messages a day gave them the best results and helped them increase their repeat traffic by 38.3%.\nScott plans to experiment with our Audience Segmentation feature to further personalize their push notifications to drive better results. He says, “We publish a lot of content on a variety of topics regularly. I want to ensure that I give our readers a personalized reading experience based on their website behavior. We’ve already started working toward creating behavior-based campaigns to send highly targeted push messages.”\nPush Notification Tips by Scott McBayer:\nDon’t bombard your subscribers with push notifications. Rather, go slow! Gather subscribers at first; identify the type of posts that work well with them; keep an eye on the data; and then send out targeted notifications for the best results.\nUse web push notifications in tandem with other marketing channels, such as Facebook, Linkedin, etc. as a unified marketing campaign works well in the long run.\n    “VWO Engage immensely helped us with retention marketing. We’ve successfully increased our repeat traffic and have been driving engagement using VWO Engage,” said Scott McBayer, Marketing Manager at Mindenegyben Blog, when asked about his experience using VWO Engage services.",

        "raw_contents": "About PearlsOnly\nFounded in 2003 by Paul Lepa and headquartered in Houston, Texas, PearlsOnly is an online jewellery store specializing in the sales of pearls. A company that was born out of the sheer chance of luck is today a business worth more than $3 million with ever-growing customers in the United States, Canada, UK, and Australia.\n  One important component of Paul Lepa’s growth strategy since the company started is conversion optimization. He has been using VWO and its professional services to optimize different domains of his website – primarily US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\nGoals\nPaul Lepa wanted to optimize his company’s website across all its domains and improve its checkout page and home page in order to increase revenue.\nObservations\nEven though PearlsOnly had been testing and making required on-site changes since the company was started, owing to a lack of dedicated resources and industry expertise, it was failing to make the best use of conversion optimization.\n  “As we tested, we realized that it was hard for our in-house developers to fully concentrate on site changes and A/B testing. Moreover, our knowledge set was also falling behind and we wanted to take a shortcut to get the site optimized. When we found that VWO had a consulting group, we reached out”.\nPaul Lepa\nFounder and CEO\nTests run\nThe team of VWO consultants approached the problem with a structured and step-by-step process. They started with research, followed by ideation, design, and then the test:\nResearch: VWO Services analyzed PearlsOnly’s existing Google Analytics data and found some areas for optimization. They saw that a lot of people were dropping off at checkout and that the homepage had a high bounce rate.\nDuring the heuristic analysis done using VWO, the team found that the checkout page was cluttered and was distracting the users from the main CTA. To confirm these observations, they analyzed recordings of visitor sessions on the checkout page and found that visitors weren’t paying attention to the USPs and instead clicking on elements that were taking them away from the page. VWO lets you filter recordings on a wide set of parameters to look for insights from a unique set of visitors. Take a free trial to explore its features! \nThis is what the checkout page originally looked like:\nIdeation: Armed with these observations, VWO Services first began optimizing the checkout page.\nDesign: The VWO team created an improved version of the checkout page by keeping the CTAs in focus. They removed irrelevant details from the page and highlighted the main CTAs like shipping cost, specific offers, and so on. This is what the variation looked like:\nThe test: The aim of the test was to increase visits to their checkout page and increase revenue. WIth US visitors as the audience, the campaign was run for close to a month before the variation outperformed the original. The same test was run on other domains like UK, AU, CA, and DE, and similar results were achieved.\nResult: The test increased PearlsOnly’s revenue by 10%. After optimizing the checkout page, the team next tested the homepage which again resulted in an increase in revenue for PearlsOnly.\nConclusion\nNot only did VWO provide the tools that helped PearlsOnly optimize its pages leading to an increase in revenue, but the VWO Services team helped solve Paul’s optimization problem rooting from lack of resources and expertise. Their friendly business terms, insightful ideas and will to deliver results in short time periods made Paul see value in VWO.\nYou too can iteratively optimize your website and significantly drive business growth with VWO.

They came with great ideas right at the proposal stage, making it easy to see the value they would bring to the table.”\nPaul Lepa\nFounder and CEO",

The company is headquartered in Maplewood, New Jersey, and later opened its first office in New York City.\nSpectrum Inc were their conversion consultants.\nGoals\nIncrease conversions by using appropriate images, using VWO – A/B Testing software, thereby improving overall branding.\nTests run\nSpectrum Inc, Harrington Movers’ conversion consultant, suspected that the “happy couple” image on their home page doesn’t relate much to the service. Their interstate moving service pages used a generic stock image of a couple, as seen in the Control page below:\nSo, Spectrum Inc hypothesized that replacing this stock photo with an image that closely relates to the moving service will increase clicks on the CTA ‘Request a Quote‘, thereby increasing leads from the website. They used VWO to do a quick A/B test to check the relevance of images.\nTwo alternate versions with different images were pitted against the Control page above. The first version showed the image of Harrington Movers’ crew. The second version displayed the image of the truck they use for moving services. To emphasize branding, both these images also included the company’s logo.\nHere are the two versions:\nConclusion\nBoth the versions beat the Control with 98% statistical confidence level. The test has been running for three months now. It’s a close call between the two versions.\nWhile version 1 with crew image showed a percentage improvement of 45.45%, the second version with truck image was close behind with 45.05% improvement over the original.\nHere’s the comparison image:\nRapidly test new ideas to optimize your website for enhanced customer experience and conversions with VWO Testing.

        "raw_contents": "About NuFace\nNuFACE is a company that sells anti-aging skin care products. Its website attracted traffic but somehow visitors seemed shy about purchasing. The company hired interactive marketing agency Red Door to improve online sales.\nRed Door is a certified VWO partner that uses the VWO platform to provide solution to its clients.\nGoals\nThe objective of the entire campaign was to identify an incentive that would persuade visitors to complete their purchase.\nTests run: Free shipping for orders above a certain threshold reduces friction to online purchases\nRed Door hypothesized that giving customers an incentive to buy would probably solve the problem. Red Door decided to run an A/B test to figure out if adding a free shipping threshold would act as an incentive that would positively impact sales.\nThis is how the original page (the control) looked like:\nDuring the test, half the visitors were shown the original website; the other half were directed to the challenger variation with the incentive “Free shipping over $75!” placed right above the Shop NuFace button. This is  the variation that was pitted against the control looked like:\nThe purpose of the test was to give interested customers an attractive incentive to go ahead with the purchase. The premise of the test was to prove that the right incentive would, in fact, successfully nudge prospects to become customers.\nConclusion: 90% increase in purchases; 7.3% increase in average order value\nThe test results proved the hypothesis. When customers were given the “free shipping” incentive, orders increased by 90%. The results had a 96% confidence level. The company’s Average Order Value (AOV) also rose by 7.32%.\nGratifying as the results were, Team VWO tried to understand why “free shipping” worked as an incentive.\nLack of free shipping is the top reason consumers abandon their virtual shopping carts.\nResearch conducted by Dr. David Bell, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania shows that approximately 60% of online retailers cite free shipping with conditions as their most successful marketing tool.\nGiven that buyers spend more when offered the option of free shipping, online retailers would always want to offer this service to gain an edge over their competitors. But this isn’t always possible. Retailers can decide on the free shipping threshold by assessing various factors which are explained in detail here.\nThat is why online retailers offer free shipping only when the order value crosses a certain threshold. This often encourages buyers to purchase another product- if only to avail the offer of free shipping. The retailer’s average order value goes up. More important, the additional shipping costs can be absorbed without cutting into profit margins.",

They help you automate recurring billing, manage subscriptions & invoicing, and access all related metrics while letting you operate in the currency your customers are most comfortable with.\nThe Chargebee blog focuses on stories and lessons from across the SaaS landscape, and also features articles about their product and related market trends. They believe that the connections created through their blog help not just in influencing potential buyers but also in popularising their brand.\nGoals\nChargebee uses several tools and techniques to grow traffic on their website. Their marketing team is always exploring new and better channels to build a loyal audience. With this goal in mind, they decided to give VWO Engage a try.\nTests run\nIn a span of 3 months, Chargebee was able to get 2,000+ blog visitors to subscribe to notifications from their website.\nThe rate of subscriptions is around 30 per day. Preethi adds, “At this rate, by the end of one year, we will hopefully achieve 10,000+ subscribers. This will give us the brand exposure, user engagement and retention that we are looking for.”\nHowever, they decided to wait until they got a sizeable audience before they started sending out Push Notifications. The intent was to be able to measure the impact of these notifications with good statistical significance.\nConclusion\nTheir best click rate so far has been 17.11%. The notification was delivered to 533 subscribers and 92 people clicked it.\nPreethi also dug out some data to show us the actual efficacy of this notification. She added that the bounce rate was 40% and the average session duration for the above notification was 2.5 minutes.\nChargebee has decided to send one notification for every new post they publish. After analysing the results, they are also planning to send notifications on old content which is still relevant. Experimenting with timing of notifications and re-sending notifications about the same content to get more clicks is also on their agenda.\nThe effort required to send a Push Notification is less than a few minutes. They no longer have to spend time on designing visuals or CTA buttons.\nThe result? 200% increase in click-rate!\nHere’s what Preethi has to say:\n“The rate of subscription per day has peaked since we started using VWO Engage. This will give us the brand exposure and user retention rate we are looking for.“",

        "raw_contents": "About PriceCharting\nPriceCharting.com provides current and historic prices of new and rare video games and consoles such as Atari 2600 and Super Nintendo. Its users pay a small fee to get a good idea of the fair price for a video game.\nAs part of his ongoing efforts to optimize the website, JJ Hendricks, the founder of PriceCharting, selected the VWO platform for conducting A/B tests.\nGoals\nWith the objective of increasing clickthroughs on ‘download price guide’, Hendricks kickstarted this test campaign.\nTests run\nOn its product pages, Pricecharting had a call-to-action (CTA) button that said ‘Download’. Right next to it was the fee the user needed to pay to download the price list.\nFor example, on the product page for ‘Sega Genesis’ console shown below, a user would see the text ‘Sega Genesis Price List for $2’.\nJJ Hendricks believed that the existing CTA caused confusion among visitors, who did not know what they needed to download. As he put it, “The ‘Download’ button and the price made buttons for our price guide service look too much like banner ads. We felt users probably had ad blindness and didn’t click it.”\nHendricks decided to test his hypothesis. Using VWO, he set up a small A/B test. He created a variation in which he changed the text on the CTA button from ‘Download’ to ‘Price Guide’ and removed the price. This is how the variation looked.\nThe goal tracked was “CTA clickthroughs”.\nConclusion\nJust a week into the test, the variation emerged as the clear winner with 99.9% statistical significance. Changing the CTA text from ‘Download’ to ‘Price Guide’ increased clickthroughs by a jaw-dropping 620.9%!\nNeedless to say, JJ Hendricks implemented the changes.\nSo why did these relatively small changes cause such a huge impact? The simple reason is that the new text was more relevant and specific- and hence, made more sense to users.\n1) Greater relevance\nIn the variation, clicking on the ‘Price Guide’ button took users to a page where they could customize your own video game price guide. According to Hendricks, “When people view this (product) page, they are looking for the price guide for a particular type of video game.”\nSo for visitors to the website who were in fact looking for a Price Guide, ‘Download’ was not a very compelling CTA, but ‘Price Guide’ was much more relevant.\n2) More specific\nFor video game enthusiasts (who constituted the main visitors to the website), the word ‘Download’ possibly came across as rather vague. Visitors were not sure what they could download by clicking on the CTA button. On the other hand, the term ‘Price Guide’ focused attention on the goal of the page. It provided them with a clearly-defined direction and helped speed up decision-making for potential customers.\nYou may want to read this article to know more about high-converting CTAs.\n3) We read from left to right\nOur eyes track text from left to right.\nThe text in the original version read “Download Sega Genesis Price List for $2”, while the text on the variation read “Download Sega Genesis Price Guide”.\nThe second message begins by informing visitors what is on offer and ends by telling them to click on the button.\nThe second test\nHaving experienced the power of A/B testing and its role in optimizing website elements, Hendricks decided to conduct a second A/B test to see how price sensitive his customers were.\nThis was a preliminary attempt to test customer behaviour before he ran a series of tests on the actual prices. So he cloned the CTA test and tracked the same goal (clickthroughs).\nOn the previous variation, he added ‘Starts at $4’ next to the ‘Price Guide’ CTA. This is how it looked\nHe set this as the Control and tested two variations against it- one with a starting price of $2 and the other with a starting price of $1.\n*This was an internal test and the new prices were not reflected on the checkout page.\nThe results of the second test\nAlthough there was no clear winner, with a 91% statistical significance, the $4 version did much better than the $2 and $1 variations. However, the conversion rate of the $4 version was still less than the conversion rate of the winner in the previous test (0.70% compared to 1.03%).\nBased on the results, Hendricks did not add the ‘Starts at $4’ text on his product pages, but he did get valuable pricing insights for future use. The fact that $4 value did better than the $2 and $1 versions meant visitors were willing to pay a higher price- or were indifferent to the $3 range. As he said, “We will probably try some higher priced products on the landing page in the future to see if it will increase revenue.”\nApart from the insights provided by the actual test results, Hendricks’ experience underscores two important takeaways around A/B tests.\n1) Always look for the next improvement possibility\nEven if you have just got brilliant results in a test, do not stop looking for new ways to optimize your website.\n\n2) Run a dummy test before testing high-impact elements\nMaking changes to elements like price can be scary because it can impact revenue. Not testing such key elements is not the solution; the key is to run a dummy test (or an “internal test” as Hendricks called it). But do this only if you can carry it off, because a huge difference in prices on the product and checkout pages might confuse users.\nYou may want to read this blog post to learn more about A/B testing prices.",

        "raw_contents": "About ExactTarget\nExactTarget is a global SaaS provider of digital marketing services. Their expertise lies in cross-channel solutions that enable companies to run campaigns across email, marketing, social media, web, and mobile platforms. A data-driven approach allows marketers to realize a higher return on their investment.\nThey chose VWO to run a test campaign on their event landing page to identify changes that would enhance the click-through rate (CTR) to the registration page.\nGoals: Enhance Effectiveness of Webpages with Images to Increase the CTR\nIn September 2013, ExactTarget hosted Connections 2013, a premier Digital Marketing conference in Indianapolis. To attract registrations, the company developed a landing page.\nHere is the snapshot:\nThe image on the original page showed a laptop screen to draw attention to the announcement of the conference. While this image was not completely irrelevant for their conversion goal, it gave a false impression that the event was a virtual conference instead of a live event.\nTests run: Knowing Which Images Are “best” for Webpages Is a Prerequisite to Achieve Online Marketing Goals\nExactTarget knew that appropriate images could make a significant difference to how visitors perceived the information and call-to-action messages on websites. Indeed, they had experienced this in the past.\nSo, they decided to test the hypothesis that using an image that visitors would see as more relevant would improve the CTR to the registration page.\nThe original version served as the control for the test.\nExactTarget replaced the laptop image with an image of a conference, as shown in their variation below:\nMore than 11,000 visitors were tested for each version.\nConclusion: Using the “Right Images” on Landing Pages Can Significantly Drive Engagement and Click-Throughs\nThe variation beat the original by 40.18%. This was probably because the image conveyed the message of a live event buzzing with participants—a place where prospects would want to be.\nThis was just one test in a series of tests by ExactTarget. And yes, the result doesn’t directly say anything about the actual registrations from the landing page. But it did reinforce the expectation that relevant images play a crucial role in pushing visitors down the conversion funnel. Depending on which step of the funnel the test is implemented, images can even help generate leads and even registrations/sales.\nIt’s important that the images you use should look compelling. But using images only to “beautify” the site may end up as a waste of valuable real estate on websites. So, the next time you need to select an image for a web/landing page, consider its “relevance” to the purpose and messaging of the page. Use images that somehow reinforce an important feature of your product, service, or event.\nSome typical image types that are completely ignored by people are large pictures included to serve no other purpose than to “jazz up” the page. The images that were scrutinized and thought of as important content was usually product pictures and images of real people (as opposed to stock photos).\nA/B test elements of your website to increase your conversion rates with VWO.

        "raw_contents": "About Restroworks (formerly Posist)\nRestroworks is a leading SaaS-based restaurant management platform with more than 5,000 customers at over 100 locations across 6 countries. We spoke with Ashish Tulsian, co-founder and CEO of Restroworks, to understand how VWO solved their pain points.\nThe marketing team at Restroworks extensively used VWO over 12 weeks to run several tests on Restrowork’s website. This success story highlights the process they followed and the impact these tests generated for Restroworks.\nGoals\nBeing a SaaS player in a niche restaurant industry, Restroworks’ primary objective was to improve the number of sign-ups for a demo of their platform. Restroworks’ website home page and Contact Us page serve as the two most important pages in their website funnel, so the marketing team at Restroworks wanted to figure out ways to reduce the drop-off on these two pages.\nThe first objective was to improve the visits from the home page to the Contact Us page and then improve the number of sign-ups generated from the Contact Us page. On researching about tools that could help them achieve these objectives, they signed up for VWO and kickstarted their conversion optimization journey.\nTests run\nTo improve the conversion rates, the marketing team at Restroworks decided to take an iterative approach to their testing. They A/B tested two versions of the home page, and then further hypothesized improvements in the winning version. Then, they ran another test between this new variant and the winner from the previous test. Similarly, they followed this approach for the Contact Us page. Here are the details of the tests that they had set up:\nTest 1: Home Page Test—Control vs. Variation 1\nAt the beginning of their conversion optimization journey, Ashish came up with the hypothesis that adding more relevant and conversion-focused content to the website will improve user experience, resulting in higher conversions. They decided to do this by:\nIncluding effective headlines, highlighting their USP, and clear CTA on the hero image of the home page.\nReducing the scroll length of the home page by removing the not-so-important sections. (They figured out this by analyzing heatmaps and visitor recordings while using VWO’s Visual Behavior Analytics capability. Discover the power of VWO Insights to derive actionable insights and measure the performance of your website elements.

They decided to prepare mock-ups of the new variant and then run split URL tests by using VWO. This is how the control and variation looked like:\nControl\nVariation 1\nThe goal for this test was to track visits to the Contact Us page from the home page. Variation 1 produced a conversion rate of 15.45% compared to 13.25% for the control, increasing the conversion rate by more than 16%.\nTest 2: Home Page Test—Variation 1 vs. Variation 2\nTo further boost the conversion rates on the home page, the marketing team at Restroworks decided to customize their website in a way which would establish more trust and credibility among their target audience. So they decided to include prominent customer logos and testimonials on the home page and a section called “Why POSist?” (as that was the company name then) to improve relevance.\nMoreover, with the information that most of their prospects want to switch from an existing software to their platform, they bifurcated their website visitors into two categories—one for prospects who are looking to switch to a point-of-sale (POS) software application and the other for prospects who are buying it for the first time.\nAfter the new home page layout design was ready, the marketing team at Restroworks decided to test it against the winner from their previous test to validate their hypothesis. This is how the two variations of the test looked like:\nVariation 1\nVariation 2\nThe new variation increased the Contact Us page visits from the home page by about 5% in just one week of running the test. Restroworks ended up making this variation of their home page live on their website.\nTest 3: Contact Us Page Test—Control vs. Variation 1\nFor the Contact Us page, which is the most critical stage in Restroworks’ website funnel, Ashish and his team decided to look into qualitative data from VWO’s Form Analytics. They hypothesized that reducing the width of the form, adding content about what the prospect will get, and including trust signals such as logos and testimonials will improve their sign-up conversion rate. VWO Form Analytics helps you uncover friction points in your forms. Take a free trial to explore its features. \nHere is a look at the control and the variation:\nControl\nVariation 1\nVariation 1 produced a conversion rate of 11.26%, compared to 9.37% for the Control version, giving a conversion uplift of about 20%.\nTest 4: Contact Us Page Test—Variation 1 vs. Variation 2\nAs they did for the home page, the marketing team at Restroworks decided to try further improvements with the winning variation to come up with the best version possible. They analyzed the heatmaps and recordings for the winner variation, and figured out that the new optimized contact page has a lot of exit points in the header and footer menu options.\nSo they designed a second contact page, which was conversion-focused, and tested it against Variation 1. This is how the two versions looked like:\nVariation 1\nVariation 2\nThis test led to a conversion lift of 7%, and the two tests on the Contact Us page combined improved Restroworks’ conversion rates by 12%.\nConclusion\nBy following a continuous, iterative approach to their testing, Restroworks was able to fuel subsequent optimization efforts basis the learnings from the previous tests. They ran follow-up experiments after a win, ensuring that critical insights were implemented as action items.\nRestroworks was able to generate 52% more leads in a single month, which lifted their website conversion rate to 3.4%, an overall increase of 25%. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the clarity and relevance of website content, coupled with its trust and credibility signals, can largely influence its performance.\nEvery A/B testing process aims to bring a significant raise in the conversion rates, and for a SaaS website like POSist which targets niche restaurant industry, this was a 4 month long journey. After months of rigorous testing in between multiple variations of our website with VWO’s Split URL testing campaigns, we were able to register a 50% growth in our organic leads.\nAshish Tulsian\nCofounder and CEO",

        "raw_contents": "About Device Magic\nVideo always has interesting effects on conversion rate or sales on a website. In a lot of cases, video helps in explaining the service or the product, and hence increases sales. In other cases, it may actually reduce conversions (probably because it is not a good fit for that website, or that video is poorly made or presented).\nDevice Magic Mobile Forms allows organizations to quickly and easily build robust data collection systems. Using their API, developers can build rich integrations featuring push technologies such as for work orders, proof of delivery, maintenance reports, retail surveys, and others.\nGoals\nThey wanted to see if a video or series of rotating jQuery slides would work best for driving people to sign up, so they conducted a simple A/B test by using VWO.\nTests run\nThe Device Magic team tested the existing version of their home page (which had a video) against a new version, which had a jQuery-based image slider instead.\nHere’s the image of the current home page, that is, with a video:\nThey weren’t sure that the video was of sufficient quality and suspected that it was too technical. This was the reason they felt that slides might present their offering more concisely.\nCan you guess which version worked better?\nConclusion\nThey measured 2 goals:\n% conversion from home page to the sign-up page\nNumber of sign-ups completed\nInitially, their control (with the video) was beating the variation (with the image slider) and they couldn’t understand why. But then they let the test run for a while until they had a lot more data.\nTo their surprise, the result inverted to the variation outperforming the control, which is what they had expected. And this result was statistically significant.\nThe image slider variation increased conversions from the home page to the sign-up page by 35%, and the total increase in subsequent sign-ups was 31%. So, for Device Magic, the image slider worked better compared to the video.\nA key learning from this test would be to get enough data so that you are absolutely sure of the result. Also, you shouldn’t be too hasty because some detail may be skewing the result or leading you in the wrong direction.\nPatience in A/B testing is the key learning here. (We have an A/B test duration calculator online to tell you how long you should run a test before giving up on it).\nIf you have had a similar (or contrasting) experience testing video versus image sliders, do let us know in the comments below.",

        "raw_contents": "About Taloon\nTaloon.com is a Finland-based eCommerce hardware store that sells plumbing, electrical, gardening supplies, and other construction material.\nThe company uses the VWO platform for its website optimization requirements.\nGoals\nTaloon wanted to increase conversions on its product pages (that is, clicks on the call to action button Add to Cart) by reducing distractions that prevent visitors from acting on the CTA.\n  Tests run\nThis is what the original version looked like:\nYou can see in the above screenshot that social sharing buttons were placed right below the product photos.\nGoing against the popular notion, Jani Uusi-Pantti of Taloon.com decided to remove the Google+, Pin it, and Facebook share buttons from its product pages. But before implementing a change that was so radical (in the light of accepted best practices), Jani wanted to A/B test if the change would impact the effectiveness of the CTA button.\nHe set up a test by using the VWO a/b testing platform. The test ran for 2 weeks.\nThis was the variation that was pitted against the original:\nConclusion\nCompared with the original, the variation recorded an 11.9% increase in CTA\nclick-throughs.\nThe confidence level of 95% delighted Jani, who said “I didn’t really expect the a/b test results to be this good. Nice surprise!”\nBased on the test results, Jani implemented the change on its website.\nConventional wisdom is all for social sharing:\nAbout 39% of digital marketers around the world believe social sharing is effective in boosting conversions.\n84% of online shoppers use at least one social media site.\nThat is why Taloon’s A/B test results are surprising. But that’s why A/B tests are recommended, because the context of each business/website is unique. What works for one business may not work for another, even if it is in the same business. Start a free trial to see how.\nIt is thus useful to figure out what worked against social sharing buttons in Taloon’s case. We believe there are perhaps 2 reasons for this:\n1) Negative social proof\n“Social proof isn’t always the best proof – you would think that social proof helps boost conversion rates, but it doesn’t always work that way.”\nAccording to Jani Uusi-Pantti, the number of shares on most of Taloon’s product pages was zero. While a high number of shares and likes acted as a positive reinforcement, a low number of shares bred distrust in the minds of customers about both the company and the quality of its products.\n2) Distraction from the main goal\nIt’s considered a best practice to have a clear defined goal for each page and push people toward that goal by using a CTA. Angie Schottmuller, who is considered an authority on inbound marketing, emphasizes this point here:\nWhile Taloon.com used add to cart as the prominent CTA on its product pages, the social sharing buttons acted as a distraction.\nAs Jani observed, “Maybe those share buttons were just extra clutter and distraction on a very good spot.”\nYou can also test your hypotheses for conversions with VWO A/B testing.

They ship almost all over the world, and their website is available in 17 different languages.\nThe company uses the VWO platform for testing website optimization opportunities.\nGoals: Increase conversions\nA customer survey revealed to FreestyleXtreme that its customers expected more product information on the website. The FreestyleXtreme team also read many success stories about the importance of product descriptions on websites and how such information boosted conversions.\nConvinced about the need to add product information, the team added product details. In addition to product details, they also explained the benefits of each product feature in simple terms.\nThis is what the page looked like after product information was added at the top.  \nThe team wanted to test if the addition of product information increased conversions.\nTests run: Test Pages with and without Product Descriptions\nThe team ran an an exploratory split URL test. The test hypothesis was that detailed product descriptions would increase conversions.\nAs they had already implemented the changes on the website, the team used the previous page (without the product descriptions) as the variation that was to be tested against the control (which had the product descriptions).\nThis is what the variation page looked like:\nMore than 7000 visitors were tested for each version.\nConclusion: 31.38% Drop in Conversions\nThe results were unexpected. The variation (which had no product descriptions on the page) beat the control (which had product descriptions) by 31.38%. The confidence level associated was 96%. Unfortunately, this wasn’t a win for FreestyleXtreme.\nHere’s the comparison image that summarizes the entire success story:\nJust as successful changes are instructive, as conversion optimization experts, we analyzed why conversions dipped by almost a third despite adding product information that customers seemed to want.\nThere are 3 takeaways from this success story:\nThe reason the page with the product descriptions lost is probably because of its poor layout. The addition of product descriptions to the top of the page pushed product images and call to action button below the fold. Any website is a combination of elements, and it is the combined effect of all these elements that determines how well the site delivers.\nImages play an important role in increasing conversions. People prefer to be able to see what they are buying. Only if they are pleased with the product image will they likely invest time to read the product specifications or descriptions. So, visual hierarchy must be planned in a way that naturally draws visitors’ attention to images by making images one of the primary elements on the page.\nPreventing such unfortunate outcomes is why we recommend running the test before making any change permanent on the site. What worked for one website may not work for another—the information is at best useful to formulate or refine hypotheses that need to be tested.",

Within the coming months, Northmill will launch the fourth brand – Rebilla, that will offer everyday banking services such as a MasterCard, mobile transactions and international transfers.\nGoals\nNorthmill’s primary objective was to increase product awareness among customers and website visitors without overloading them with information, using concise push notifications.\nObservations\nAt Northmill, Christoffer Lundberg works as a Content Marketer, and leverages content to get maximum conversions. One of his main challenges was to find a way to win back visitors who didn’t convert, whilst building a good subscriber-base\nWith web push notifications, they wanted to make:\nVisitors aware about their campaigns,\nIncrease their conversion rate, and\nImprove customer retention.\nTests run\nChristoffer experimented with multiple push notifications to figure out what works best for the website. Since push notifications have a character limit, it made sense to use them to just talk about Northmill’s USP (Unique Selling Point) that is most urgent to many customers. The notification emphasized on how fast Northmill’s application process is, and this made the promoted action very clear.\nThey tried notifications without a clear USP as well, and there was a noticeable drop in the click rate. With the following notification, Christoffer realized that it is important to grab subscriber attention in the first few words itself, otherwise the notification wouldn’t perform well.\nNorthmill had been using other push mediums, like emails and text messages, which were already performing very well. But, they had never experimented with push notifications before. As soon as they started using VWO Engage, they were blown away by the platform’s capabilities and  the possibilities of engaging with their customers in an effective manner.\nThe initial opt-in numbers were amazing. Over 6000 people opted-in without much effort, and there was an incredible conversion rate of 15%. Push notifications gave Northmill the potential to interact with people who showed interest in their product, in a more intuitive way.\nConclusion\nAt the moment Northmill’s opt-in trigger has been set up on the home page, since it has a higher conversion rate as compared to other pages. It took them time to upgrade to a Premium account, in order to use the Segment Creator to create segments and personalize their communication for their audience.\nOne major concern with Push Notifications was the factor of perceived privacy invasion, that had to be avoided. Since Push Notifications are pretty new to the customer in their browser settings, there is a lack of knowledge on their part. The customers are unaware of what data is being collected. Christoffer wanted to make sure that the information Northmill sends out in Push Notifications doesn’t seem invasive.",

        "raw_contents": "About Soocial (now Viadeo)\n[This success story has direct inputs from Soocial CEO, Stefan Fountain.]\nSoocial is an online address book that helps you keep your phone, computer and online services contacts sane. The app syncs, merges, and provides backups so that you are never stranded without the contact details you need. It works with over 500 phone models, webmail (like Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo), and your Mac and Outlook.\nSoocial chose to use VWO – a/b testing software for their testing needs.\nGoals\nTheir first test was to increase the click-through rate on the home page to the sign-up form.\nTheir home page featured a large Sign up button. They wanted to test the age old principle of adding free to the call-to-action trigger.\nTests run\nThey tested a number of variations with different buttons, including the word “free,” different colors, and adding text next to the button. Part of this test was to see if correctness would trump brevity.\nFor example one of the tested items was Free up to 250 contacts and another was It’s free. The first was technically more correct, and the second was shorter but less “correct.”\nHere are the screenshots of the original version (control) and the winning variation.\nControl: 14.5% Conversion Rate\nVariation: 18.6% Conversion Rate\nThe only difference between winning variation and the original design is the presence of It’s free! along the side. And those 2 words increased the conversions by 28% (from 14.5% to 18.6%). This result was statistically significant and surely indicated that experimenting with the home page paid well for Soocial.\nConclusion\nWhen we asked Soocial why they thought the winning variation worked, this is what they had to say:\nBeing the nerds that we are creating Soocial, we thought that the most “correct” version would get the highest conversion. Of course, the reason to use VWO is to confirm or deny our hypotheses and we will be testing a lot more variations in the coming weeks. Our hypothesis on the winning combination is that it doesn’t require any thought what-so-ever from users that it’s a low-risk solution.\nWe followed up the question by asking what lessons can be derived from the test. Here is what they had to say:\nTo be honest we aren’t sure yet [of what impact this makes to the actual sign-ups]. We wonder how these tests measure up to the goal funnels in Google Analytics and compared to actual conversions into paying customers. It could be that we get more users to signup and lose them later in the process. That is of course still valuable because it means we can have more call to actions to convert to a paying customer and test the conversion there.\nInvaluable. The ease and speed of setting up the test is brilliant and we can wait to start seeing the results on pages behind our login [a new VWO feature] to test on converting users to premium accounts. It will be very interesting to see the test results merely by changing the wording, graphics and positioning.\nStefan Fountain\nCEO",

        "raw_contents": "About Optimeria\nKarsten Lund is the CEO of Optimeria, a Danish company, which is a VWO-certified partner. He wrote about this success story wherein he managed to increase sales by 15% by optimizing the checkout page.\nSlideShop offers great powerpoint templates at a cheap price.\nGoals\nThe checkout on SlideShop itself is a simplistic version of a normal checkout process, because they sell a digitally downloadable product (PowerPoint presentations + elements). There are 3 simple steps in the overall process:\nEnter the email address.\nChoose the payment option.\nPay and download the product.\nThey identified 3 main problems with the current Enter the email address page (step 1 in checkout) and decided to address it, hoping to decrease shopping cart abandonment.\nTests run\nThe test was a radical split URL test where they bundled multiple elements into a single treatment and put it to test against the control (the original checkout page). Prior to constructing the variation page, they made use of an extensive range of conversion flow analysis and also used findings in other tests from the same client.\nOriginal checkout page\nVariation: 15% Increase in Sales\nConclusion\nThe results were +15.05% conversion rate increase with a 98% statistical validity and 200+ conversions per treatment.\nHow the Concerns Were Addressed\nConcern #1: Why are you asking for my email address?\nAs you surf over the Internet as a shopper, a lot of decisions are made from intuition. Your brain only asks you from time-to-time to justify a choice your subconscious had already made for you. So in many ways, you are actually shopping on autopilot.\nThis autopilot does not like when things aren’t as expected. This is especially true for the checkout step, because it is so close to making an actual payment. Therefore, they needed to address the concern (on the SlideShop checkout page) of asking for an email address without any explicit motivation.\nThey addressed this issue by adding a value to the transaction (Send download to this email address) and stressed that email information would not be misused, sold, or shared. They fulfilled the value to the customer in this exchange.\nConcern #2: When I get through all this, what can I expect from your product / services?\nThere are always unique concerns that only apply to one business, product, or service and in this case, they already knew that one of the concerns of the customer was “How can I actually use your product after I’ve downloaded it.”\nThey addressed both issues at the very center and prominent position, just beneath the call to action, to signal to the user that they know these concerns were there and that customers shouldn’t be worried about them.\nConcern #3: OK, I will do the payment, but what if my credit card info is stolen?\nWhen a call to action is as crucial as “continue to payment options,” it’s also going to set in motion some common insecurities about the next transaction. Even if we all know that we aren’t going to be charged anything before filling credit card details, we don’t like the feeling of being in a situation where security issues aren’t addressed before moving on to the actual payment step.\nThis concern was addressed by adding the following to the variation:\nWhat kind of different credit cards are accepted\nTrust seal by Verisign to ensure transaction will be safe\nKnown security items of the actual payment transaction (like PCI compliance, Verified by Visa, etc.)\nKey Learning\nSome of these elements were unique for SlideShop and the market in which they operate, the learning from this success story is that it is crucial to address key concerns (conscious and subconscious ones) at the right stage in a decision process.\n   ",

        "raw_contents": "About Melbourne Innovation Centre (MIC)\nMelbourne Innovation Centre (MIC), situated in Melbourne’s North East stands as a prominent business incubator dedicated to supporting the growth and success of startups, entrepreneurs, and small businesses.\nMIC provides a diverse array of support and training, including access to weekly workshops and events, advisory services, educational materials, and business content for businesses aiming to thrive in their respective industries. This forward-thinking approach aligns with its overarching goal of contributing to the growth and development of businesses within the innovation ecosystem.\nThe center truly embodies the spirit of entrepreneurship by continually striving for improvement through initiatives like conversion rate optimization. A noteworthy aspect of their CRO activities includes conducting A/B testing with VWO.\nWhy VWO \nI highly recommend VWO to anyone looking to enhance their conversion rates through A/B testing. The platform’s user-friendly interface, comprehensive reports, and valuable support make it an excellent choice for optimizing website performance.\nJamie-Lee Kay\nDigital Technical Team Lead at Melbourne Innovation Centre\nGoals\nThe digital team at MIC strategically leverages their website’s homepage to generate leads. However, they observed a dip in the conversion rate for the lead form and were keen on enhancing this aspect to optimize lead acquisition.\nObservations\nUpon initial analysis via heatmapping and Google Analytics, the team noted that the existing calls to action (CTAs) could use a more compelling appeal to boost engagement. Moreover, the main H1 heading lacked resonance with the audience. It did not effectively communicate the value proposition or prompt users to complete the application form contributing to an early drop-off from the page. Consequently, the lower conversion rate was hindering the achievement of anticipated application numbers.\nHypothesis\nBuilding on their observations, the team hypothesized that introducing an audience-relevant H1 heading, coupled with slight adjustments to the secondary text and the creation of a more compelling CTA, would lead to an increase in the conversion rate of the homepage forms.\nTests run\nFueled by the hypothesis, the team at MIC conducted an A/B test to gauge the impact on the number of clicks and submissions on the application form.\nIn the control version of the homepage, the H1 heading adopted a formal tone, emphasizing a broader perspective that could encompass multiple aspects, including technology, software, and overall digital transformation. The secondary text maintained a similar tone, providing references to the offered services. The CTA text simply stated, “Get started.”\nIn contrast, the variation version of the homepage featured an H1 heading with a slightly more direct and casual tone. It specifically addressed the immediate needs of individuals or businesses seeking prompt improvements in their online presence. The secondary text adopted a more lucid approach, succinctly showcasing the offerings in a concise word count compared to the control version. The call to action (CTA) text in this variation read “Apply now.”\nThe results of the A/B test yielded intriguing findings. Across all the metrics analyzed, the variation version consistently outperformed the control version. Notably, the variation version generated a higher number of clicks (8.60% more) on the ‘Apply now’ button. Furthermore, it exhibited an impressive 8.56% improvement in application submissions compared to the control version. \nConclusion\nArmed with the insightful results from the A/B test, the digital team at MIC promptly implemented the necessary content updates to their homepage. Reflecting on the process, the team emphasized that without conducting this A/B test with VWO, such crucial changes wouldn’t have been made, potentially causing a considerable loss in the number of applications. Encouraged by these positive outcomes, the team is now eager to launch new A/B test campaigns in VWO, maintaining a proactive approach to continually enhance website conversion rates.\nIf the success of Melbourne Innovation Centre has piqued your interest and you want to explore the capabilities of VWO, here’s your chance!

        "raw_contents": "About Best Choice Products\nMore than 30% of e-shoppers site search while shopping online. When visitors use the search bar on a website, they know what they’re looking for. \nYet, optimizing and continuously experimenting with search UI/UX is one of the most under-utilized best practices by eCommerce business owners. \nNothing kills a visitor’s enthusiasm faster than a search bar that does not deliver accurate results or worse, is not noticeably visible.\nMeet Best Choice Products\nBest Choice Products is a California based eCommerce company selling high quality, low priced home, garden, music, children, and fitness products.  BCP takes pride in its diverse categories and selections by aiming to provide an uncomplicated shopping experience for their customers.\nFast forward about 16 years, Sky Billiards has transformed from a small-scale business to a thriving and diverse e-commerce brand called Best Choice Products (BCP). \nGoals\nAlex and Kelly are the marketing and design innovators at BCP. Like most eCommerce marketers, they are obsessed with driving mindshare in the fiercely contested red ocean and improving the shopping experience on their site.\n“We are constantly iterating our designs in tandem with user insights. Earlier we weren’t checking how these releases were impacting our conversion rate, revenue, and other metrics beyond GA data. We were using a different tool that didn’t offer A/B Testing capabilities. \nWe realized that we were collecting data, but weren’t acting on it. That’s how we started looking for an all-inclusive platform that provides A/B testing, heatmaps, scroll maps, on-page surveys – and we came across VWO.” says Kelly Klopfer, UX Design Manager at Best Choice Products.\nAlexandra Diaz, UX Designer at BCP adds, “We’ve seen that a lot of marketers act on hunches. They’ll claim things like, I believe that our conversions will increase if we add a picture carousel instead of a static image. But what if your visitors don’t like the carousel? What if they find it too distracting? The truth is, you’ll never really know what works with your customers  and what doesn’t unless you test it.”  \nObservations\nTaking The Guesswork Out of Mobile Web Optimization\nAlex and Kelly noticed that more than 50% of their traffic were mobile users. On diving deeper into their analytics data, they realized that — Users looking for products using the search icon in the header were converting 60% higher than others. \n“BCP sells products that people already know of and use in their day-to-day lives. Since visitors using the search bar were making a purchase v/s the ones that weren’t, we decided to test our search bar. We created a variation with a giant search bar and placed it right at the center of the website’s header, like how Amazon does it. Our goal was to drive conversions by making the search bar more prominent” says, Kelly Klopfer, UX Design Manager at Best Choice Products.\nTests run\nSetting Ground Rules\nObjective: Improving the visibility of the search bar will improve user penetration into the website\nAudience segmentation: Mobile traffic\nVariations: 1\nDuration: 1 week\nGoal: Track conversion rate by identifying visitors that reach the post-purchase thank you page\nA/B test details\nTest and Learn Without Limits\nThe goal of the A/B test was to find out if a bigger search bar gets better conversions. Here’s how both the versions of the test looked like. \nDecoding User Behavior \nAnalyzing Heatmaps:\nBCP - Heatmaps - Control\nAs shown in the picture, Variant received higher clicks as compared to Control. \nThey further analyzed click maps to see which version was more preferred by visitors. \nAnalyzing click maps:\nControl\nVariant\nAfter running this test for a week, Alexi and Kelly decided to see the results. The report was divided into two sections – the impact on revenue and the impact on conversions. \nTracking All The KPIs\nLift in Conversions\nControl\nVariation\nSide-by-side comparison of both the variations\nTotal revenue\nConversions per visitor\nLift in revenue\nConclusion\nManaging Trade-Offs Like A Boss\nThis experiment helped Kelly and Alexi understand both the positive and negative impacts of the campaign. They went through session recordings to understand how users are interacting with the new search bar v/s the old. Apart from conversions, they also made observations based on visitor drop-offs, page sessions, time spent on each page, etc for future experiments. Take a 30-day free trial with VWO today to get in depth knowledge of user behaviour on your website\nDon’t ignore the Search Bar\nWe asked Kelly for her concluding thoughts on the experiment and here’s what she had to say, “ We hadn’t changed our mobile header navigation in over a year. Revealing the search bar helped us get more clicks, searches and a revenue uplift of 0.1% within a week! I’m sure we’ll see higher numbers in the months to come.” Kelly Klopfer, UX Design Manager at BCP.\n“There’s so much one can do with A/B testing, the possibilities are endless! Experimentation has become the new go-to-market strategy for BCP. We generate ideas by looking at data from VWO & GA and explore design solutions. Then, we compare them with competitor designs and discuss them with the development and management team before moving forward with the campaign.” adds, Alexandra Diaz, UX Designer at BCP.",

The Performics team set out to reduce conversion leaks and boost conversion rates on their client HDFC -ERGO’s website to help them offer a seamless experience to its customers.\nObservations\nThe Performics team conducted an in-depth analysis of the HDFC ERGO website. They zeroed down on two paid campaign insurance pages and two insurance pages with organic traffic. Here are the findings for each page:\ni. Car insurance paid campaign page: Opportunities for enhancing user engagement by refining the hero banner and clarifying the value proposition.\nii. Health insurance paid campaign page: 65% drop-off rate from page views to lead submission, missing hero banner, and unclear value proposition.\niii. Car insurance SEO page: Focus on streamlining user interaction and improving lead capture efficiency.\niv. Health insurance SEO page: 60% drop-off rate from page views to lead submission, missing hero banner, and unclear value proposition.\nHypothesis\nBased on these observations, the team formulated the following hypotheses to increase lead conversions for each page:\ni. Car insurance paid campaign page: Personalize the content and optimize options for new vs. existing vehicles.\nii. Health insurance paid campaign page: Revise the lead form with a clear value proposition and display only the key fields in the first fold.\niii. Health insurance SEO page: Optimize the lead form and ensure all fields are visible in the first fold.\niv. Car insurance SEO page: Redesign the lead form for better comprehension and make all fields visible in the first fold instead of just a single input field.\nTests run\nThe hypothesis led to A/B testing the mobile version of the landing pages using VWO. Let’s go through each landing page test, the intervention made, and the outcomes achieved.\ni. Car insurance paid campaign page\nFor this landing page, the team developed a variation with several key changes compared to the control (original). The updates included a clear and concise value proposition: “Get car insurance with a 100% Claim Settlement Ratio.” They replaced the complex text with simple wording and made “Registered Private Car Detail” a non-mandatory field. The call-to-action (CTA) was strengthened to “Get a Free Quote Now,” and the icons were optimized for better visibility and consistency. Additionally, they added a hero banner. Here’s how the control and the revised versions compared:\nThe test ran for two weeks with a 50-50 traffic split, and the variation emerged as the clear winner. Here is the impact of the variation on KPIs.\nii. Health insurance paid campaign page\nFor the health insurance paid campaign page, the variation included several key changes compared to the control. The top banner was updated to convey a clearer and more compelling value proposition. The email section was removed from the form to make it shorter and easier for users to complete. The plan type option was made more easily selectable. The call-to-action was changed from “Buy Now” to “Get Free Quote in Just 2 Steps!” to encourage user engagement. The offerings were transformed from a list type to a tile type for better visual appeal, and the hero banner was updated to feature a smiling person, making it more inviting.\nHere is how the control and original looked:\nThe A/B test ran for two weeks with a 50-50 traffic split, and the variation came out as the winner. Here are the results of the changes that were made.\niii. Car insurance SEO page\nThe car insurance SEO page underwent an A/B test with several key changes in the variation. These changes included a stronger headline in the hero section to highlight the main value proposition, making the “Registration Number Textbox” more visible, and adding the keyword “Free” to the “Get a Quote” CTA.\nAdditionally, trust signals were introduced in the first fold, and a hero image was added for a more engaging visual appeal.\nHere is how the control and original versions looked:\nThe test ran for nine days with a 50-50% traffic split and ended with the variation emerging as the winner. The variation improved the lead conversion rate by 38%.\niv. Health insurance SEO page\nAn A/B test was conducted for the Health Insurance SEO page. The variation included several key changes compared to the control.\nFirst, a strong headline was added to the hero section to highlight the value proposition. The form was optimized by keeping all fields visible in the first fold, ensuring users could easily see and complete it. The call-to-action (CTA) button was enhanced with a more prominent design and clearer text: “GET FREE QUOTE NOW.”\nAdditionally, the information hierarchy was improved by clearly listing benefits, such as “Get Ultimate 4X Health Coverage.” An image was also added to the hero banner for a more engaging visual appeal.\nHere’s a look at how the original and the control compared:\nThe A/B test ran for nine days with a 50-50 traffic split.

        "raw_contents": "About Noble Studios\nNoble Studios is a creative digital performance marketing agency based in Nevada, USA. Starting in 2003, they have emerged from Carson City and expanded to Reno, Las Vegas, and the UK. Being a ‘digital original,’ Noble Studios has fostered independent thinking, creativity, and compassion in their team to make meaningful connections, one of the company’s core values. Noble Studios has been recognized with distinguished honors in the digital marketing industry, including becoming a Google Premier Partner and one of the fastest-growing companies by INC 5000. \nNoble Studios has a dedicated CRO team that facilitates clients’ websites experimentation. VWO has been their choice of partner for their experimentation requirements due to the competitive pricing, key features, and the simple and effective interfaces it offers for test building.\nTesting methodology\nIdeas are the lifeblood of a CRO program, and choosing which experiments to run is critical for saving clients time, money, and ultimately success. Noble Studios uses its ideation methodology to focus on the best tests to run given time and traffic are limited. Through this process, using a prioritization model that balances estimated test impact vs. effort, Noble Studios can democratize good ideas and eliminate bias to let ideas prove themselves rather than choosing by subjective preference. \nGoals\nIn our conversation with Noble Studios, we gauged the opportunities their client Travel Nevada had with their newsletter signup rates. They wanted to increase the visibility of the newsletter signup section on the Travel Nevada website and reduce the friction for visitors to complete the signup process. To accomplish this specific goal, Noble Studios prioritized the CRO issues on the website and tackled them one by one. This approach enabled them to tackle one issue at a time and feed learnings from one test into another in an iterative, generational testing model, giving definitive and data-driven conclusions in each test.\nObservations\nNoble Studios conducted an A/B test using VWO Testing on Travel Nevada’s website to see if expanding the newsletter signup section automatically at 75% scroll depth would translate into increased signups. The variation resulted in increased signups with no negative effect on other engagement metrics.  \n  In the second test, Noble Studios tested the position of the “fixed elements.” Those elements were originally the share and email widgets fixed to the side of the screen. The test had variations positioned on the left-hand side and right-hand side on desktop and at the bottom of the screen on mobile. The variation having right-side elements on desktop performed best for newsletter signups with minimal impact to engagement metrics. \n  In a subsequent test, acquainted with learnings from the previous tests, Noble Studios went a step further. They ran a test with a variation having a right-side fixed element that auto-opens once 75% scroll depth is reached, and therefore, presenting an opportunity for visitors to complete the signup process staying within the widget itself, without being directed to a dedicated newsletter signup page.\nTests run\nThe collaborative team of Noble Studios and Travel Nevada hypothesized that expanding the newsletter signup at 75% scroll depth will lead to an increased number of signups. \nTest 1: Nest the newsletter signup\nThe control flyout would pop out, but then disappear after no interaction. In the control version, there was no way to re-activate the pop out.\nControl – View 1 (Flyout displays after scrolling 75%)\nControl – View 2 (Flyout disappears after no interaction)\nVariation – View 1: (Flyout displays after scrolling 75%)\nVariation – View 2: (Flyout remains accessible after no interaction through a tab)\nThe variation received more signups than the control, which declared the variation as the winner with no negative impact on other engagement metrics. \n  Take a free trial with VWO to understand how easily you can set up A/B tests and get interpretable results. \n  Test 2:\nIn the second experiment, Noble Studios tested which position of the fixed elements would lead to increased signups.  \nThe variation with right-side elements on desktop performed best for newsletter signups with minimal impact on engagement metrics. \n  Test 3: Direct newsletter subscription\nThe third test combined the learnings from the previous tests to hypothesize that a variation having a right-side fixed element that expands once 75% scroll depth is reached will lead to an increased number of signups. In this test they took it a step further and included the sign up form within the widget for the Variation.\nControl view:\nVariation view:\nThe team observed the primary metric that was newsletter signup clicks. They monitored both the original signup button (on a standalone page) and the new newsletter signup (within the fixed widget). The newsletter signup button variation had an increase of +385% at a 100% probability to beat control. \n  Using combined insights from previous tests (right-side fixed widget + auto-open widget at 75%), Noble Studios was able to dramatically increase overall newsletter signups, with an additional 104 signups from the variation received in 7 days of test running time.\nConclusion\nBased on the learnings from these generational tests, Noble Studios identified a need to optimize the newsletter’s thank you page experience. Converted visitors were left stranded on the landing page and unable to continue their site exploration. Additionally, they hope to find new and better ways to trigger the newsletter flyout widget with considerations such as triggering after #X pages, #X scroll depth, #X time on site, etc.\nVWO has been an incredible partner and their platform helps us get real results with tangible insights for our clients. The ability to set up as many goals as you want, on the fly, is incredibly valuable to keep an experiment moving and get as much insights as possible.  \nMason Furr\nAssociate Director of Performance Marketing\nNoble Studios currently runs one to five tests per quarter for each of its clients. They are steadily increasing their testing velocity by working towards having ownership over implementation and development capabilities, and are hopeful that this will ensure smooth test timelines with more streamlined communication. \n  Start a free trial with VWO to understand how A/B testing can help you achieve better testing velocity and increased conversions for your business, or learn more about Noble Studios’ conversion rate optimization services and how they achieved their results.",

        "raw_contents": "About ADT\nADT, a Tyco International company, provides safety solutions for residential and commercial properties. Its portfolio includes burglar alarms, video surveillance, access control, electronic article surveillance, radio frequency identification, fire detection, integrated solutions, and 24/7 monitoring.\nTo test its new website, ADT UK hired Bloom, an integrated digital marketing agency. Bloom needed to determine which CTA was more effective in conversions; and to test these CTAs, they used the VWO platform.\nGoals: Increasing Conversions\nFollowing the launch of its new website in December 2013, ADT saw a 20% jump in conversions. The company believed that further testing would enable them to identify opportunities to further increase conversions by optimizing website elements and thus enhancing usability across different device types.\nOne of the elements the company and Bloom identified as a lever for higher conversions was the CTA.\nThe original CTA invited visitors to Book a Free Survey. This is what the page looked like.\nTests run: Refining CTA Text to Resonate Better with Users\nKeen to see if a different CTA would encourage users to submit an inquiry form, ADT and Bloom decided to test 2 variations of the CTA button copy. The control was tested against Variation 1 with the CTA Book An ADT Survey and Variation 2 with the CTA Get a Free Quote.\nAs the CTA was located across the site, ADT would have needed to change the CTA text on every page. To create 2 variations of the CTA text and to test each of these, ADT and Bloom  used the URL patterns option of VWO. They didn’t need to change the CTA on every page.\nA screenshot of Variation 2 is shown below:\nThe test was run for 14 days. It was targeted at 50% of new visitors, ensuring that no participant had previously seen a different CTA. The test was primarily focused on increasing the conversion rate of residential leads; however, secondary conversions were tracked for commercial leads as well, to analyze the full breadth of customers.\nTo gain a clearer picture of the broader ADT customer and to understand how PPC and organic users, as well as any direct or referrals, converted, traffic sources were not segmented. This was achieved by easily integrating the test with Google Analytics (GA) and analyzing the data. The traffic was split equally between the control and 2 variations:\nControl – Book a Free Survey\nVariation 1 – Book an ADT Survey\nVariation 2 – Get a Free Quote\nThe words survey and quote were used to determine if either would significantly increase lead generation. In other words, did visitors to the ADT website have more of an affinity to the word “quote” or “survey”? The use of “ADT” in the CTA text was based on previous user testing, which indicated that users wanted to know if they would be getting an “ADT survey” rather than an independent security survey.\nConclusion: 60% Increase in Conversion Rates\nWithin 2 weeks, Variation 2 (where the CTA said Get a Free Quote) outperformed both the control and variation 1, and showed a 60% increase in conversion rates.\nVariation 1 was automatically disabled, as ADT had enabled VWO’s Automatically disable losing variations feature to ensure that lead volumes were not impacted by a poorly performing variation.\nThe control and the winning variation are shown below:\nBased on the test results, ADT decided to implement the new CTA site-wide.",

        "raw_contents": "About Overtoom\nOvertoom, part of the international Manutan Group, is a major European player in the office supplies and services space.\nThe company used VWO to set up and run its A/B tests.\nGoals\nThe aim of this campaign was to improve conversion rates which in the case of Giuseppe Hentenaar meant increasing the number of visitors clicking Add to basket.\nTests run\nGiuseppe Hentenaar, Webshop Marketer at Overtoom, felt that adding some information near the call to action (CTA) on the product pages would push more visitors to click the Add to Basket button.\nHere’s how the original page and CTA looked. The Dutch In Winkelwagen translates to Add to Basket.\nGiuseppe created a variation page on which he added the following 3 pieces of information just below the CTA:\nBeoordelingen (Star ratings from customers)\nGratis bezorgd, voor orders vanaf EUR 200 (Free delivery for orders above Euro 200)\nBetalen op rekening of online met (Pay by invoice or online with Visa or MasterCard)\nHere’s a screenshot of the variation:\nThe variation was A/B tested against the original by using the VWO platform.\nOvertoom ran the test for around 10 days before the variation achieved an almost 25% increase in conversions with a 99.9% statistical significance.\nConclusion\nThe variation beat the control, delivering almost 25% higher conversions.\nAn understandably thrilled Giuseppe said, “VWO showed us that we had 25% higher conversion with the variation on the product page. Awesome improvement!”\nAs always, it is useful to understand why the variation worked. In this case, 3 changes were made, but Giuseppe had chosen each of them with care. Each element played an important psychological role in pushing customers to the next stage of the funnel.\nThe presence of the Star Ratings served to assure visitors\nThe free shipping threshold served to lure visitors\nThe multiple payment options nudged visitors gently to make the payment\n1) Star Ratings (Assure)\nCustomer rating was the first weapon in Overtoom’s conversion arsenal. Its objective? To eliminate fear and assure the customers that they are dealing with a trusted name. Giuseppe placed the ratings right below the Add to basket button to give it maximum visibility.\nAccording to an Infas survey, 65% of online consumers in Europe say that star reviews are important for them when choosing a website. Another study by Nielsen shows that 70% online consumers trust customer reviews on websites.\nAs Giuseppe said, “We thought we should give our customers some kind of assurance. We wanted to let them know it’s safe to buy from us. The test worked because the customers are convinced about buying the product after seeing other customers give us a 4.5/5 star ratings.”\n  2) Free shipping threshold (Lure)\n\nAfter a potential customer’s fears had been allayed by building trust through display of customer ratings, the next step was to give them an incentive to move forward with the purchase.\nThe word “free” is a powerful motivator. To know more about the virtues of the word “free,” we suggest you read behavioral economist Dan Ariely’s book Predictably Irrational or at least his post on why people tend to buy things they don’t want in the first place, just because they are free.\nBut it’s not just the word “free” that tempts here. It’s free shipping for orders valued at more than Euro 200.\nAccording to a Deloitte study, 40% of online consumers are willing to buy more items if they qualify for free shipping. Another study by UPS reveals that 39% of customers often purchase enough to qualify for free shipping. For the seller, this means a higher average order value.\n3) Payment Options (Gentle Push)\nAfter assuaging the buyer’s fears and tempting them with an incentive, the variation gently pushed prospects to take the final step of making the purchase by giving them payment options.\nGiuseppe Hentenaar had this to say about VWO: “The tool (VWO) really helped us with this A/B test, and gave us the perfect insights.”",

        "raw_contents": "About Zwitserleven\nFor over 100 years, Zwitserleven has been providing financial advice and services aimed at enabling its clients to strive for a relaxed life after retirement and a financially secure old age. Its clients include employers and employees of Directors-Major Shareholders (DMSs), Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and various large companies.\nThe company uses VWO’s Visual Editor for its website optimization requirements.\nGoals\nThe company’s landing page attracted a high volume of traffic from AdWords, but its inability to push visitors further into the conversion funnel was a cause of concern. They knew that if they could get visitors to click beyond this page to the next step, that is, the sign-up page, they could increase their number of leads. So taking the increase of click-throughs to the sign-up page as their goal, Zwitserleven kick-started their testing campaign.\nTests run\nThis was the control page they were trying to improve:\nThe team felt that the existing call-to-action text was vague. They hypothesized that changing it from Ga Verder (Go Further) to a more specific Meer Informatie (More Information) would give people a better idea about the company’s services. In turn, that, they believed, would increase the click-through rate from the landing page.\nThey created the following variation with a modified call-to-action text:\nThe A/B test pitted the variation against the original. The test was run on the VWO platform.\nHere’s the Comparison Image that shows the changes that were made:\nConclusion\nThe variation beat the original, increasing click-throughs to the sign-up page by 14.41%. The result had a statistical confidence of 99.9%. Based on the historical average conversion rate, this translated to a 5% projected increase in the number of annual leads generated by the website for the company.\nSo why did such a minor change work?\nThe CTA buttons on a website serve as signposts that guide visitors. If the CTA text on your website do not clearly guide prospects on their journey to purchasing your products or services, they can feel lost. Most will respond by just moving to another website.\nThe original CTA text said Go further, referring perhaps to the prospect’s post-retirement life. But most visitors probably did not make the connection. The revised CTA button text More information was direct and simple to understand. Not surprisingly, it performed better than the  Control and improved conversions for Zwitserleven.",

In 2010, he single-handedly launched the SEO Hacker Blog, to create a conversation around the rising importance of SEO in marketing and branding. When the website is not talking about the most recent and pivotal trends in the SEO industry, they are hosting SEO tutorials for marketers and website owners. Today, the widely read SEO Hacker is managed by Sean and a team of 20 like-minded SEO specialists.\nGoals\nOne of the core goals of Sean’s SEO Hacker website is to engage their audience through blog posts. Sean was using emails to reach out to his readers. But soon, he realised that email was reverting to its original nature of being cluttered. He decided to give his communication strategy an extra push, complementing his current channels with VWO Engage to see what effect it had on SEO Hacker goals.\nTests run\nSean sends a push notification each time a new post is published. He also sends follow-up notifications to get more page-views on the same post.\nInspired by the ease of using VWO Engage, he experimented with a couple of things.\nAt first, he sent the same notification at different times on the same day, to reach out to people who missed the previous one. For such a notification, Sean managed to get a click rate of 9.8% the first time, and 6.52% the second time.\nAfter a gap of few days, he sent the same notification again. This time he got a click rate of 8.99%.\nThese test cases may not work with email. However, push notifications are real time and to dismiss them, people simply have to click on the exit icon. Also, with VWO Engage, you even have the option to make a notification auto-fade after 20 seconds if users don’t click it. There is no redundancy as in the case of opening your inbox to see the same email twice or more in a short span of time.\nSean also experimented by sending the same notification, with just a few words changed, twice in a gap of 3 days. The first time he sent the notification, he added the phrase “Click Here”. While in the second notification, he didn’t add the word “Click”. The first one got a click rate of 16.53% and the other, got a click rate of 13.11%.\nSee the 2 notifications below:\n2 variations of the same Push Notification with & without the word \"Click\"\nConclusion\nWithin 3 months of signing up with VWO Engage, SEO Hacker clocked 3069 subscribers. Sean sends an average of 6 notifications in a month. The average click rate of notifications so far is 11.71%, and the best click rate is 16.53%.\nSean uses VWO Engage to engage his audience with the content on SEO Hacker website. In his words, “I’m trying to get people to return to my site whenever I have a new post. That’s really the most important thing for me – a retained audience.”\nAn indirect benefit he observed was that repeat visits often led to more social shares. And when asked if he would like to recommend using website push notifications as a communication channel, he said, “Do it. Now. You’re welcome.”\nAccording to Sean:\n“The ease of using VWO Engage allows great room for experimentation- be it with content, time, or frequency of reaching out to my subscribers.“",

CreditLoad understood that they needed to opt for a new marketing channel to allow them to directly interact with their audience and build lasting relationships them.\nTests run\nWhile conducting an extensive research, Daniel Wesley discovered that push notifications on mobile were receiving an astounding open rate of 40% for the finance sector. This made for a compelling reason for the company to add push notifications to their marketing outreach initiatives.\nDaniel and his team, with the help of VWO Engage’s push notification services, researched industry best practices and engagement metrics such as clicks and unsubscribe rate to capture the attention of their audience. Based on this study, they decided on a push notification frequency of three messages per week — every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nThey realised that their homepage and blog were the most frequently visited pages by visitors and decided to place their ‘Opt-in’ message on both these pages to increase their subscriber base.\nConclusion\nAfter using VWO Engage’s push notification services, CreditLoan® saw a 350% rise in user engagement. Their repeat traffic grew significantly, with consumers spending more time on the website than ever before.\nHere’s a quick glimpse of what CreditLoan® achieved using VWO Engage’s push notification services:\nTheir first notification itself helped them gain their first set of 230 subscribers.\nImproved visibility with their consumers – some of whom were not even aware about the content that CreditLoan offered.\nIn comparison to the previous month, their push campaign demonstrated a 22.09% lift in their revenue.\nVWO Engage helped them achieve a CTR of 8% as compared to 1.5% through emails.",

The company offers perfumes, cosmetics, and other toiletries and operates globally.\nThey were aware that their site had an overly complicated registration process, but wanted to collect actual data to support the suspicion.\nThey used VWO for A/B testing the changes.\nGoals\nThe goal of the Blivakker team was to prove that a small change in a web form would lead to an increase in the form registration conversion rate.\nThe hypothesis (supported by experts) was that by reducing the number of form fields, the conversion rate would increase. If they could show a significant increase in the conversion rate by making small changes to a form, they would revise the entire purchasing process.\nTests run\nThe original form had 17 form fields. The team reviewed the form fields and chose to remove 3 fields immediately; account number, phone number, and phone number evening. The goal was to remove even more fields, but this was difficult due to technical limitations.\nThey set up 3 different versions of the registration form step in the process:\nControl – the original form\nSkjema-light – the original form minus 3 form fields (account number, phone number, evening phone number)\nSkjema-uberlight – a completely stripped down form with fewer fields and less navigational elements\nHere are the results from the A/B test:\nThe red marker in the image below shows which fields were removed:\nConclusion\nThe tests showed that when you reduce the number of unnecessary fields in a form, you increase the number of registration(11% higher form submissions in this case). The test also shows that it’s not optimal to remove too much information from a form.\nThe most important consequence of this minor test is that the company now understands the importance of a fast registration process. Within a few months, more key processes will be analyzed and simplified to increase online sales.\nEditor’s note: This success story was originally posted at Tribes.no.

        "raw_contents": "About Underwater Audio\nUnderwater Audio is a US-based supplier of products such as aqua goggles, swimbuds headphones, and waterproof iPods. Customers from several countries around the globe order its exclusive products through its eCommerce website.\nThe company uses the VWO platform for its website optimization work.\nGoals: Increase sales\nThis is what the original home page (the control) looked like:\nThe primary business need was to increase sales through the company’s online store.\nTests run: Improving visual hierarchy to guide visitor actions\nThe Underwater Audio team knew that it had only a few seconds in which to grab the attention of visitors, convey to them what your site is about and the value they will derive and how you want qualified leads to move forward (towards the purchase).\nAs the team considered additional elements that could be changed to drive engagement and sales, the concept of “visual hierarchy” was proposed. In essence, this is about using subtle visual cues to guide the thought pattern of visitors so that they process information the way you want them to and take the action you want them to.\nWhile visual hierarchy is a much-talked-about subject, not many consider it as the basis for A/B testing ideas. But the Underwater Audio team decided to test this aspect of its website.\nSpecifically, the team wanted to test the hypothesis that because of the F-shaped eye scan pattern of visitors, swapping the placement of the call-to-action (CTA) button and the testimonial bubble would visually reinforce the thought progression of title>quotation>action. In turn, this would make Underwater Audio’s case more compelling, and thus increase sales.\nAn added benefit of this change would be that the main image of the product, which was hidden under the testimonial bubble in the Control page, would become more clearly visible.\nWith VWO, you can easily validate your redesign ideas through A/B testing. Take a free trial to check out for yourself!\nThis is the variation page after the CTA button and the testimonial bubble were swapped:\nThe A/B test was set up and run on the VWO platform.\nConclusion: 35.6% Increase in sales\nThe A/B test proved the hypothesis. The Variation beat the Control with a 35.6% increase in sales.\nHere’s a comparison image that shows what changes were made in the variation:\nThis success story emphasizes that web design is not only about aesthetics. The relative “visual weight” of various elements on the web page is what decides how clearly it conveys your message to visitors.\nIn this case, the variation improved the prioritization of visual elements. Right after telling visitors what product was available, the new visual hierarchy almost forced visitors to read the customer testimonials. This served to increase credibility by providing social proof and in turn, guided visitors’ decision-making further into the sales funnel. Thus, it was the new visual hierarchy created by Underwater Audio that helped visitors connect the dots and understand the story being told by the web page.\n\nIn the Control page, visitors who proceeded to the next page probably did not read the customer testimonial; this made the product and its value proposition less credible, and possibly impacted sales.\nThe redesigned landing page follows many landing page best practices mentioned by Oli Gardner, Co-Founder of Unbounce.\nSome other aspects worth mentioning although they remain unchanged in both versions:\nThe most important category “Products” in the top navigation bar is reinforced by bold text and increased font size.\nThe testimonial by a professional swimmer is absolutely relevant to their aquatic industry type. The larger font size is used to bring attention to the important part of the testimonial.\nThe color of the CTA button made it stand out even though its placement was switched from the whitespace in the Control to a relatively darker background in the Variation.\nDetails such as price are not mentioned on the homepage to avoid scaring away visitors.  This information is revealed only after the visitor has shown some interest- by which time, some credibility has been built around the product and its value.\nTrust elements such as the customer care telephone number on the top right and the security seal from GoDaddy on the top left add credibility to the site.\nFree shipping, warranty period, and payment methods available are other basic concerns that are addressed on the home page itself so that only qualified leads proceed to the next step.\nFor effective visual hierarchy, before you begin designing your page, it is important that you first figure out the goals of the web page that are most important for you and those elements of the content that will contribute to those goals.\nVWO gives you the ease and confidence to validate your test ideas before you ship them.

A popular site, traffic was around 100,000 visitors per month.\nThis is what looked like:\nDespite the high traffic, conversions were relatively low. Visitors to the site were not clicking on the “Add this to my cart” button, which was the precursor to final purchase.\nThe website targeted students from large urban centers as well as smaller towns. But in India, online purchases were still at a nascent stage and largely limited to the larger cities where internet penetration was higher and access to smartphones, computers, and connectivity was much better.\nThe GreyBox team hypothesized that many potential customers (some of whom first-time online buyers) may not be familiar with the original call-to-action (CTA) text, which said: “Add this to my cart”. They felt that changing the CTA text to a more direct and easy-to-understand “Buy now” would increase clickthrough rates from the product pages.\nA variation with the CTA text changed to “Buy now” was created and using the VWO platform, A/B tested against the original page. This is what variation looked like:\nConclusion\nThe hypothesis was proved because the variation page beat the original, pushing 8.41% more visitors down the conversion funnel. The confidence level associated with the test results was 98%. Considering the traffic received by Pcmbtoday.com and the fact that 42% of “add to cart” translated into final purchases, the change was significant in terms of its expected impact on sales.\nEspecially for an online business, understanding customer needs well is vital- but unless the website “speaks the language of the target audience”, traffic and engagement will not translate to sales. In a country like India, where English is spoken widely but with varying levels of fluency, simple CTA text that is likely to be easily understood by the target audience is vital to pushing them to the next stage of the sales funnel.",

Whether to get some “real” work done, go to a meeting, or even on vacation, AwayFind makes sure that the urgent messages the user specifies still finds them.\nGoals\nHeadline is the first thing a visitor notices on a page. If it is not clear, a visitor would just take a broad look at page and leave after a few seconds. But if your headline catches his attention, he would try to understand more about your offering by looking at the copy.\nBased on this premise, AwayFind intended to improve the conversion rate on their home page, which gets a mix of traffic from organic, direct, and PPC (AdWords) sources.\nTests run\nGetting the headline right is crucial, but getting the copy right is equally important. AwayFind had an interesting headline which said: Checking email every 5 minutes? Stop!\nOn their original home page, this headline was extended with another headline (of exactly the same size, font, and color). It said: Let us find your urgent messages. Here’s how their home page looked:\nThe team at AwayFind thought of simplifying the copy around headline and slightly changing the layout as well.\nThey used VWO for doing this A/B test. Here’s the variation:\nNote how they removed the second part of the headline and instead replaced it with a sub-headline.\nConclusion\nAwayFind thought the new copy was slightly more compelling and that the new layout drew the eye more naturally to the call to action button. And they were right!\nThey saw a 42% lift in visitors clicking through from the home page and a 91% lift in people completing the setup process.\nThey admit it themselves: The results were shocking! Small change, big results.\nRegarding VWO, they mentioned that VWO made it easy to implement the test and even easier to track the results.\nWhat they learned was that a little copy can go a long way. Four new sentences dramatically improved their results. As a follow-up, they are planning to test the new copy with the old layout to see which of these variables created the biggest impact—a more direct copy comparison.",

Powtoon uses its tool to create funny and engaging explainer videos. Its customers come from various business verticals.\nGoals\nPowtoon’s pricing model was based on features such as watermark removal, privacy control, quality, export options, and others. Storage was a recently-added feature.\nPowtoon offered 3 plans:\nA free plan offering 100 MB storage\nA $19 monthly pro plan that offered 2 GB storage\nA $59 monthly business plan that offers unlimited storage\nThis is how Powtoon’s pricing page originally looked:\nFor any SaaS firm, the pricing page is closest to the funnel, so PowToon believed that optimizing this page would drive conversions.\nTests run\nDan Rimon, Director of Product at PowToon, hypothesized that the “unlimited storage” feature offered under the business plan was an unquantifiable and vague commodity whose true value could not be perceived by prospective buyers.\nWe didn’t know exactly how our target audience would perceive the ‘storage’ capability. Both our business plans (unlimited and 2 GB) offer practically unlimited storage. The fact that we were not able to crunch the feature in real numbers (unlimited) may have been leading to the wrong perceived value.\nDan Rimon\nDirector of Product\nPowToon selected VWO services to test out different pricing levers. The plan was to test different storage values for the Pro and Business plans. Dan tested 3 versions against the original (which offered Unlimited versus 2 GB storage for the Pro and Business plans, respectively):\n10 GB storage in the Business plan and 10 GB storage in the Pro plan\n2 GB storage in the Business plan and 2 GB storage in the Pro plan\n10 GB storage in the Business plan and 2 GB storage in the Pro plan\nThe third version with 10 GB storage for the Business plan versus 2 GB storage for the Pro plan turned out to be the winner. Here’s the winning version.\nThe 27.9% increase in revenue was attributed to the new pricing page clearly enabling visitors to perceive the difference in value between the 10 GB and 2 GB options.\nWe attribute the results of the test to our users’ abilities to really understand the value they were getting. Users responded better to a real number (10 GB) than “unlimited,” which frankly sounds lovely but is hard to quantify.\nDan Rimon\nDirector of Product\nConclusion\nDelighted with the 27.9% increase in the revenue as a result of tweaking and testing its pricing page, PowToon has taken the route to continuous testing of its pricing page to keep optimizing it. Their product team runs a test every two weeks and shares the results and learnings internally- even if the test results are inconclusive.\nHaving tested the effect of storage plans as a revenue driver, the PowToon team used VWO solutions to test if the way their monthly and annual pricing plans were displayed psychologically impacted the way visitors chose a particular plan.\nLeverage data-driven experimentation to optimize metrics that matter: from free trial to purchase, and beyond, with VWO. Start your free trial today!\n  Although the original version outperformed the variation in this case, they nevertheless made this cool video to share the results internally. The ability to build hypotheses about different aspects of their website and test them has helped in transparent and objective decision-making within PowToon’s web team.",

Makelaarsland decided to A/B test its lead generation page to increase the number of sign-ups for listings.\nTests run\nMakelaarsland’s website had a simple registration process for home listings. Interested visitors would need to provide their personal information, the address of the property to be sold, and then click Finish.\nToward the right, the lead generation page had a Need Help? section with the company phone number and email address. There was a picture of a woman employee below this section.\nThis is how the original page looked:\nThe Traffic Builders team hypothesized that instead of a woman employee’s image, an image of a man putting a Sold sticker on a For Sale sign on the lead generation page could improve the number of visitors deciding to list their homes.\nAccordingly, they created the following variation, and then ran an A/B test against the original.\nThe test was run for 20 days at 95% statistical confidence before Makelaarsland implemented the changes on its website.\nConclusion\nCompared to the original version (the control), the variation recorded a significant 89% increase in sign-ups/listings.\nEva Louwen, Traffic Builders’ senior conversion optimization consultant and the person who authored and executed the test, pointed out that the variation used a persuasion technique known as “response efficacy.” The new image was effective in suggesting that the action of signing up would result in the desired outcome of selling the house. And that’s the outcome potential Makelaarsland customers were looking for.\nExplaining her choice of this psychological premise, Eva said, “I picked it because it addressed the low response/trust issue problem with Makelaarsland.” She further explained, “People that sign up Makelaarsland as their estate agent want to be sure they’ll eventually sell their house. We used this technique by adding an image of a man putting a ‘sold’ sticker on a ‘for sale’ sign. This visual reassurance ended up convincing more visitors that signing Makelaarsland was indeed the right move to make.”",

Aimed at replacing a range of other certification cards, it delivers standard and consistent training that complies with the National Code of Practice of Australia.\nThe FAQ section on the site explains that it is mandatory for a prospect to have a white card if the prospect wishes to work in the construction industry down under.\nValidation from the industry helped drive traffic to their website. However, not all visitors to the site signed up for their course.\nThe company hired Conversion UP (a team of conversion specialists based out of Australia). Grant Merriel from the agency turned to VWO.\nGoals\nThe clear objective for Grant and his team was to increase the number of visitors who signed up for White Card courses.\nBased on an analysis of the website, Grant observed that even though the home page contained differentiating factors of the business (money-back guarantee and same-day-dispatch of certificates), these were buried somewhere deep on the page (below the fold) where few visitors ever went.\nTests run\nTo understand the pulse of customers and their concerns about the site, Grant and his team went through support tickets filed by users, sat down with the client for a one-to-one discussion, and went through site analytics.\nBefore going into a lot of data, the test idea came from solving the most common questions that customers were asking, as it suggests that there was a large disconnect between what the business offered and the website.\nGrant Merriel\nOperations\nBased on the research, the team concluded that the trust badges on the site were a significant source of competitive advantage. He hypothesized that making these badges clearly visible would create the desired impact, that is, higher sales.\nAccordingly, the team proposed 3 changes to the original home page:\nChange CTA text from Click to Purchase to Start Now.\nChange the CTA and subheading background color.\nAdd trust and guarantee badges below the hero image.\nA variation was built, and then an A/B test was run to test the effectiveness of the changes. VWO tools were used to set up and run the test. The test was run on 6,585 visitors over a period of 3 weeks.\nThe original page (the control) and the variation are shown below:\nConclusion\nThe variation beat the original page. The winning variation recorded a robust 32% increase in visits to the payment page from the home page, and a 20.9% increase in clicks on the payment page.\nTo put things in perspective, the control yielded 21.79% visits to the payment page linked to the home page CTA and 10.13% conversions on the payment page CTA. The variation trumped the control with 28.76% conversions from the home page and 12.25% on the payment page.\nBoth results had a confidence level of 99.9%, which means that the variation would deliver these conversion rates vis-a-vis the control almost every single time.\nOn being asked why he thinks the variation won, Grant pointed to 3 factors:\nChange from a confusing heading to an actionable button.\nEasy to understand what the “Next Step” is for the user (and above the fold).\nProminent supporting sales propositions just below the fold.\nIt is worth trying to understand these factors in greater detail to see why the variation performed better. Just as important is to see if we can distill out relevant web design principles.\nThe simple reason is because the variation addressed user needs better. The average user reads about 28% of the text on a web page, spending less than a minute doing so. Clearly, most websites don’t have much time to impress users and nudge them toward engaging with the site.\nColors and Contrast\nThe control had one color theme for its header, the hero message, and the CTA button.\nWhile all 3 were important parts of the user experience, each served different functions. The header laid out the site structure for a quick browse-through; the hero message intended to clearly communicate the core value proposition; and the CTA button existed to nudge visitors to take a particular action.\nThe use of a similar color theme for all 3 key elements on the original site created a visual barrier of sorts for users. It all comes down to contrast because our eyes are led by colors, and the perceived contrast among different elements on a page. Zero contrast equates to zero attention.\nBy representing the 3 page elements in different colors, the variation succeeded in effectively leading the visitor’s attention from one element to another, all separately perceptible. This was the first reason why the variation delivered better conversion results.\nMessaging\nThe second reason why the variation outperformed the control was messaging. Put yourself in the shoes of the typical individual (likely a male) hoping to get into the Australian construction industry.\nHaving read up on the prerequisites for a job in the industry, he was convinced that he needed to complete the necessary training and receive the white card.\nThis user comes to know about White Card Courses and immediately looks it up on the web and lands on the home page. He’s greeted with this hero message:\n“Get White Card Online $50.00” and below it,\n“Click here to Purchase”\nBut think about it. The user hadn’t gone there to “purchase” anything. He only wanted to do the training and get his white card. But there was no mention of beginning the course. The to purchase CTA button conveyed the message that the user would first have to part with hard-earned money, without any evidence or guarantee that he’d get his training. In such situations, the user would hesitate and then just leave.\nWith the variation; however, the messaging was changed to something more appropriate, something more in line with the immediate intent of the visitor. The user would find the message:\nGet White Card Online $50.00\nStart Now\nHere, the user is told exactly what he’d have hoped for—he could start with the course right away. Clicking it would still lead the user to a payment page. But the user doesn’t mind it so much anymore, because he knows he’s clicked Start Now, and is in the right direction.\nCheck out this useful post from WordStream on creating effective call-to-action messaging.\nTrust Badges\nThe third reason was that the Trust Badges on the variation were displayed more prominently than on the original website. In human-to-human interactions, brains crunch verbal and nonverbal cues to detect and assign a measure of credibility or trust. But on a webpage, in the absence of any human element, visitors must be shown clear reasons to trust, especially on eCommerce sites that require payment before delivery.\nThe trust or guarantee badges on the original page were not easily visible, which left the site with a pretty low credibility score. In contrast, the variation carried 3 easily-visible badges, one each for guarantee (money-back), trust (recognized Australia-wide), and an assurance of quick turnaround time (same-day dispatch of certificates).\nBut what about the 20.9% increase in conversion on the payments page? There was no mention of any change to that page. True, and yet, the page converted 21% more than the control. Trust badges to the rescue again—these appeared above the fold, ensuring that most visitors saw the badges before they clicked through to the payments page.\nParting thought: Best practices are not static. Over time, they become common practices.\nA/B testing should always be designed keeping in mind business objectives and current data. Adopt tests that have worked for other businesses only if you see clear commonalities between your business and theirs. It is perhaps better to come up with your conversion optimization opportunities.",

        "raw_contents": "About ISM eCompany\nHeadquartered in the Netherlands, ISM eCompany is a well-known full-service digital commerce agency. It uses future-proofing and distinctive data-driven digital marketing techniques to help its clients achieve their digital and optimization goals. ISM eCompany has been using VWO Experience Optimization platform since 2011 for all their A/B testing and conversion optimization needs.\nIn a recent conversation with Loef Kleinmeijer, Team Lead Conversion & CRO Consultant at ISM eCompany, he shared his experience using VWO and some of his learnings from the recent experiments he and his team ran for their clients.\nElaborated here is a multi-goal experiment ISM eCompany ran for their client Staatsloterij, a Dutch-based state lottery ticket company. Staatsloterij provides people with an opportunity to win huge prize money through a lottery draw system. \nGoals\nStaatsloterij’s primary objective was to provide comprehensive information about its XL option and get more people to select it during the checkout process to increase the lottery ticket size.  \nThe XL option allows an individual to play twice with the same ticket number, win prizes from the monthly prize package, and also win prizes from the XL prize package.\nObservations\nThe execs at Staatsloterij saw that XL transactions were consistently low on both desktop and mobile. Despite the presence of a tooltip, not many people selected the option. They approached Loef and his team to understand the problem and seek assistance on increasing XL selections and lottery ticket sizes.\nTests run\nLoef and his team conducted an in-depth analysis of the XL option using VWO’s capabilities. They used heatmaps, sessions, and other qualitative research tools to understand why visitors did not select the XL option. \nThey discovered that visitors often encountered the XL option for the first time on the shopping cart page. Many even clicked on the XL toggle and tooltip out of curiosity to learn more about it. However, the tooltip hardly provided any valuable information about the XL option because of which most visitors switched off the XL option and proceeded to check out.   \nLoef and his team hypothesized that by adding more information about the XL option in the tooltip and explaining why visitors should choose the option, they should be able to increase the XL option selection and the lottery sale amount.  \nThey used VWO Testing to run a Split URL test. They created a new version of the checkout page for both desktop and mobile and added two elements on the checkout page.\nAn arrow with text to increase the focus on the XL toggle option.\nMore information about the XL option in the tooltip and why visitors should select the option. \nHere are the control and variation for desktop and mobile, respectively.\nDesktop Version\nMobile Version\nThe team ran the test for 17 days on both the platforms, with traffic split equally between the control and variation. Here’s what the team analyzed:\nDesktop:\nThe number of transactions increased by 1.04%.\nVisitors clicked less on the tooltip, possibly because the arrow focused much attention on the XL toggle option than the definition of XL.\nVisitors switched on the XL toggle more than switching it off (+ 8.16%).\nThe arrow with text focused on the extra chances of winning, which served as a motivator.\nMobile:\nThe XL explanation had a negative impact on the number of transactions (-1.10%.)\nVisitors clicked on the tooltip less often.\nMost visitors switched on the XL toggle more than switching it off (+ 8.35%).\nThe number of transactions compared to the desktop was less, possibly because of the arrow and text position. \nConclusion\nAfter observing an uplift on the desktop, the team deployed the change and it’s currently live on the website. Meanwhile, an uplift wasn’t observed on their mobile platform, and hence, the team is currently contemplating to run more experiments with different designs to achieve their objective of more XL selections. \nISM eCompany runs every experiment with one primary end goal: getting an uplift in revenue through successful A/B test implementation. They plan and strategize in a manner that every experiment run provides enough learnings for them to grow and achieve their goals.\nStart your free trial today to know how A/B testing works.\nVWO is well suited as an experimentation tool for many of our mid- and large-sized clients. It offers an easy setup and implementation, both for CRO specialists/analysts and developers, sufficient functionality and segmentation options for a relatively economical price\nLoef Kleinmeijer\nTeam Lead Conversion & CRO Consultant",

Their reader base consists of people who want to know what’s really happening in the country, and how these events can impact the world.\nThe goal of the website is to provide easy access to the latest news, presented in a truthful, honest way. Apart from focusing on high quality reporting, they also encourage constructive debates and exchange of ideas among their readers.\nGoals\nTheir primary objective of the company was to provide easy access to the latest news to its readers across the globe.\nObservations\nThe website constantly focuses on maximising user experience and finding the best ways to deliver news. When they signed up for VWO Engage, they already knew that sending push notifications was a great way to build a loyal audience. But, understanding the true capabilities of the tool was a challenge for the company.\nTests run\nUnlike other online publishing websites, news portals produce new content by the minute. So it’s important to decide on the frequency of sending updates to their readers.\nInitially, WIN was experimenting with the frequency of sending push notifications and dispatching two updates on a daily basis. However, their Notification Consultant from VWO Engage noticed that they were losing around 170 subscribers a day and initiated a discussion with them to find out the root cause of this problem.\nOn a trial basis, the news website reduced their frequency of sending push notifications to six per week. The experiment gave them positive results. Not only did the number of unsubscribes came down, but they also started collecting 90 new subscribers every day. They currently enjoy an average click rate of 15%.\nCurrently WIN has a notification subscriber base of over 37,000+ users.\nConclusion\nWorld Israel News finds web push notifications a great way to bring people to their website. However, they feel that the character limit of 48 characters for the notification title is a bit too short for their liking. On the other hand, their favourite VWO Engage feature is the ‘Quick Preview’ which enables them to see a short summary of what will be sent across when they clicked on ‘Send Notification.’\nThey have a word of advice for the other online publishers out there – test to see what kind of notification copy works best for your audience before taking an action.\nWe asked them how their experience with VWO Engage has been so far. Here’s what they had to say, “The notifications get sent right away. We don’t need to wait a few seconds until it is actually sent. Also, VWO Engage’s customer service is great and friendly, and very prompt. They are always available when you have a question or issue, which is important, as pushes can be very timely.”\n“The notification gets sent right away. Also, [VWO Engage’s] customer service is great, friendly, and very prompt,” said a senior executive at World Israel News, Media and News Website, when asked about their experience with VWO Engage.",

The platform’s robust A/B testing functionalities and clear data analysis have enabled Publicis AI team to conduct insightful experiments and significantly improve Aapka Painter’s website’s conversion rates. \nSourabh Arya\nHead - Martech and AI\nHypothesis\nThe Perfomics team analyzed user behavior data for the lead form using Performing Funnels (their AI-based framework for conversion rate optimization). The process led to the hypothesis that reducing the number of steps in the form and simplifying the paint selection process for the users would increase the completion rate and improve the number of leads from the paint cost calculator form.\nTo simplify paint selection, the team categorized the paint types into Economy, Premium, and Luxury based on the hypothesis that this would make it easy for users to select a paint available in their budget. \nTests run\nBased on the above hypothesis, the team chose to test the entire user journey of the paint cost calculator form using VWO Testing. Since there was a significant overhaul of the user journey, the team decided to utilize VWO’s Split URL testing.\nVWO’s Split URL testing enables you to easily split your website traffic between two different URLs for the same landing page.\nThe variation included the following changes:\nReduced the form from 5 steps to 3 steps.\nSimplified the product mix selection fields for easy identification of paint types.\nPositioned the “economy paint category” field at the beginning with a default selection to expedite the user journey.\nHere is how the new journey looked:\nThe Split URL test ran for a week, and the variation emerged as the winner. It garnered a 40% increase in leads overall, with a remarkable surge of 200% in leads on the final day compared to the control group. Additionally, it achieved a 1.4x rise in average engagement time per session, coupled with a 30% reduction in drop-offs.\nConclusion\nPerformics’ strategic use of Split URL testing with VWO has greatly enhanced the user experience, leading to substantial online success for Aapka Painter.\nImpressed by these results?

Developed by Jagex and launched in January 2001, the enormously-popular game has welcomed over 250 million players to its world since its release. More than 2 million users play every month, and millions more watch avidly through social channels.\nRuneScape has consistently striven to deliver a great experience to its users not just in the game but also on its website. After all, it’s the website where users find forums and game guides and buy in-game items.\nGoals: Grow Revenue by Increasing the Number of Purchases\nAbout 50% of users on the RuneScape website arrive as direct traffic. The other half of the traffic comes from referrals, social media, and email marketing campaigns.\nCommenting on this traffic mix, Rob Marfleet, UX Specialist at Jagex, responsible for User Experience and CRO across the payment flow on the website (the payment gateway and its preceding pages), said, “This is mainly down to RuneScape enjoying a very loyal user base, with many players having played for several years.”\nRob appreciated the need to test and optimize various pages on the website and had a CRO team to assist him in optimizing conversions. This team included Jagex’s Dave Parrott, Payments Services Director and Nastassja Gilmartin, Payments Manager, who helped in identifying testing opportunities and analyzing test results.\nDisha Ahuja, Client Success Manager at VWO, helped the team utilize the VWO platform to its full potential. A team of designers and developers facilitated implementation of winning test variants on the RuneScape website.\nThe CRO team focused on optimizing high-potential pages, that is, those that were closest to the payment gateway and required minimum effort in optimization. The Treasure Hunter page on the website was one such high-potential page that the team chose to optimize. The Treasure Hunter page let users buy keys to unlock treasure chests in the game. The treasure chests contain items that can be used within RuneScape.\nRob explained, “Treasure Hunter activity is an optional mini-game within RuneScape- keys are earned through play, but can also be gathered in bundles that are purchasable on the site.”\nOptimizing conversions from the Treasure Hunter page was thus important.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nOn clicking Continue on the Treasure Hunter page, users were directed to the Payment page from where they could choose from multiple treasure chest packages.\nPayment page\nTests run: Conversion Optimization to Increase Number of Purchases\nThe RuneScape CRO team followed a structured process that involved the following steps and the use of VWO tools such as heatmaps, session recordings, and A/B testing:\nSetting a goal\nFinding opportunities for optimization\nCreating hypotheses\nDeveloping variations\nAnalyzing test results\nSetting a Goal\nThe goal of the optimization campaign was to grow revenue by increasing the number of purchases.\nFinding Opportunities for Optimization\nThe CRO team studied a heatmap of the Treasure Hunter page and found that a significant number of users were clicking the Get Keys section on the page—a section that was not clickable. This led them to infer that users either wanted direct access to the keys or wanted to search for further information.\nHeatmap of the original page\nNext, the team analyzed session recording sessions on the page and observed that many visitors on the Payment page returned to the Treasure Hunter page. The team thus realized that the Treasure Hunter page probably did not offer users sufficient information about the treasure chest packages.\nCreating Hypothesis\nBased on the above insights, the team hypothesized that providing details about treasure chest packages on the Treasure Hunter page would lead to more conversions on the Payment page.\nDeveloping a Variation\nTo test the hypothesis, the team created a variation of the Treasure Hunter page that included a new section highlighting 4 treasure chest packages. Here’s how it looked:\nAn A/B test was run to objectively determine which page, original or variation, performed better.\nConclusion: 10% Increase in Purchases in Less Than a Month\nThe test ran from August 15, 2016, to September 13, 2016.\nThe variation outperformed the original page and increased the number of purchases by almost 10 percent.\nTest Result Report on VWO\nBuoyed by the success of the A/B test, the RuneScape CRO team believed that further optimization was possible. The team realized that the offer of 4 treasure chest packages left users spoiled for choice. The team hypothesized that recommending one of the packages to users would help them choose better and, consequently, increase conversions.\nBased on this hypothesis, the following variation was created:\nThe variation featured a Recommended package. This variation was pitted against the winning page from the first A/B test.\nThe variation won and further increased the number of purchases by almost 6%.",

The company uses the VWO platform for its website optimization efforts.\nGoals\nThe goal of this test was to increase sales for tablet users thereby increasing Shirtinator’s revenue.\nTests run\nThe company directed traffic from desktop and laptop users to one website; traffic coming from mobile devices, including tablets, was redirected to a mobile website. However, the mobile website had been created keeping in mind the small screen of phones; it was thus not optimized for tablet devices.\nThis is how a product page from the mobile website looked:\nSimon at Shirtinator wanted to try directing traffic originating from tablets to the new HTML5-based desktop website that they were developing.\nHere’s how a product page from their new HTML5 website looked:\nThe team at Shirtinator set up a split URL test by using VWO for traffic originating from android-based tablets. [You may read this article from our Knowledge Base on how to perform traffic segmentation tests].\nVisitors who became part of the test were split equally between the existing mobile version of the website and the new HTML5-based desktop version. To be sure of the business impact of the test, they set up revenue tracking in VWO for this test. In other words, the goal of the test was to test if the new HTML5 website was better for driving sales for tablet users and to track revenue.\nHere’s an image showing a comparison of how the 2 websites looked:\nConclusion\nThe new HTML5-based website outperformed the mobile website for tablet users by a stellar 71.81% in terms of absolute revenue. The number of orders completed went up by 32%.\nMobile experience cannot always be scaled up to an optimum tablet experience. Mobile websites and apps are made such that there is no left or right content and design demarcation. Users need to scroll vertically through the content. If we scale this design up for a bigger and wider tablet screen, it will lead to a lot of space being wasted. Also, there will be no proper eye-path for visitors.\nShirtinator’s mobile website was clearly not a good way to engage traffic originating from tablet devices. The company, therefore, gained by directing such traffic to the desktop website.\nIf you have an eCommerce website, you should look at this built-in report in Google Analytics to find out the percentage of traffic coming from desktop, mobile, and tablet. And if you have a sizeable percentage of traffic coming from tablets, it makes sense to optimize UX for them. You may read this blog to know what to avoid when creating a tablet experience for customers.\nA usability study by the NNGroup has confirmed that one of the primary uses of tablet devices is web browsing and that regular websites work fairly well on tablets even with few modifications. You may also want to read a similar case-study by Smashing Magazine, which resulted in the mobile website being abandoned altogether.\nA new, responsive design was adopted to give users the best-possible experience consistently across device types.",

Divakar believed that following a structured process to optimize conversions was a move in the right direction, and expected that conversion optimization would be adopted deeper and wider into the marketing function.\nGoals: Increasing Visits-To-Order from the Home Page\nDivakar’s team was focused on optimizing the home page and category pages. They acted as owners for the home page and collaborated with the respective category managers for the category pages.\nEach element of the home page was carefully tracked for conversion signals. This data was then used for hypotheses development and testing.\nTest 1 – Home Page\nThe main navigation bar links on the home page were getting a lot of clicks, especially “Wholesale,” which was the first link. The team identified the need to send better qualified traffic to the category pages as a primary challenge.\nThis is what the home page originally looked like:\nOriginal\nTests run: Minor Changes, Big Impact\nThe ShopClues team hypothesized that replacing “Wholesale” with other marketing categories (like “super saver” bazaar) and moving it to the left navigation bar might make the page more visually aligned and help attract better qualified visitors to each of the category pages.\nThey came up with the following variation:\nVariation\nRepositioning “wholesale” also meant the change had to be highlighted to the visitors. For this purpose, the team displayed a banner that said “new” right next to “wholesale.” This change further improved the CTR on the “wholesale” category.\nTest 2 – Marketing Category Page\nWith the category pages, the team obtained data from the analytics team, deployed VWO heatmaps where required, and sent reports to the respective managers, who then pointed out areas that might have required attention. Based on this feedback, Divakar’s team created hypotheses, prioritized testing, and implemented the changes.\nBy using VWO’s Visitor Behavior Analysis, the team noticed that for one of their promotional categories (Sunday Flea Market), filters like “new arrivals,” “best selling,” and “price sorting” were getting the bulk of user attention. Here’s how the original page looked:\nOn-Page Surveys were then used to collect feedback from visitors themselves about these filters. Based on the insights gathered, a variation was created where visitors were spared that step in their search. The variation presented visitors with the products that matched the filters upfront in a horizontal display. VWO lets you discover a goldmine of insights on your visitors’ peculiar behavior. Take a free trial to check out for yourself!\nThis is how the variation looked:\nThis test resulted in a stupendous 48% higher visit-to-order.\nConclusion: 26% More Visits-To-Order from the Home Page; 48% from the Category Page\nThe new top navigation bar with the marketing categories delivered 50% more CTR. Not only did the improvement in visits-to-order (26% from the home page and 48% from the category page) translated to higher revenue, but these also improved the quality of visits.\nTake a free trial with VWO to understand more about how we can aid you on your optimization journey. \nAcknowledging the support his team received from VWO’s Customer Success team, Divakar had this to say:\nVWO consists of a complete set of tools and features using which I was able to infer how visitors use the site (heat maps, visitor-recordings etc) and even how they feel (surveys). Gleaning insights from these data, I could strategize and easily launch A/B tests, multivariate tests, personalization triggers and more to optimize our funnel. The complete process of “data driven” optimization through this tool is self-explanatory and easy to set-up\nDivakar Ravichandran\non-site merchandising team",

Both calls to action that hinted at a video significantly increased the number of visitors who clicked to the sales page (step 3). The best-performing variation (variation 1) increased conversion by 14.18%.\nVariation 1 Results\nA/B Test #2 (salesletter test)\nIn the second split URL test, Carl tested 1 variation of the sales page:\nThe control was a long-form salesletter, which had been tweaked extensively over 2 years.\nVariation 1 was a 1-minute professionally produced video where Carl demonstrated his best abdominal exercise. At the end of the video, the “call to action” said that more exercises could be found in the manual and the workouts.\nVariation 1 of Carl’s Second Sales Page\nHere are the results for test #2 (the goal was to go to the next step of the funnel). The video sales page significantly increased the number of visitors who clicked to the price/guarantee page, by 46.15%.\nResults of Test 2\nA/B Test #3 (Follow-up test)\nThe third split URL test was a follow-up test. Through this test, Carl tested:\nThe winning video only\nThe winning video at the top of the page plus his longstanding control sales letter below\nTo his surprise, the video-only page won. Here are the results. Adding the long sales letter below the winning sales video significantly reduced the number of visitors who clicked to the price/guarantee page by 35%.\nTest 3 Results\nCarl couldn’t explain these results. He shared his best guess:\n“I’m guessing visitors were intrigued by the sales video and clicked through to the price/guarantee page to get more info. They may have been turned off by the long salesletter when I added it to the video and lost the excitement created by the short, punchy video.“\nConclusion\nAdding the long sales letter below the winning sales video significantly reduced the number of visitors who clicked in the price/guarantee page, by 35%.\nVideo converts! It did so when mentioned in a “call to action” (a 14.18% increase) and also when used to sell (35% and 46.15% increases in 2 different tests).\nAs more and more surfers have broadband Internet and powerful computers, video seems to be slowly taking over the web. Carl increased his conversions with video…why not test it and see if it increases yours?\nI carried out these tests using VWO. It’s easier to use, faster, and more user-friendly. VWO’s website itself is faster. It loads in a flash. Creating tests is intuitive, quick, and easy. It’s done through a “visual” interface. In short, VWO loads the page you want to test. One last word on customer support: in two months, I’ve emailed the team 26 times. On average, I’ve gotten a response the same day. VWO team is smart and dedicated. This level of customer support is unheard of.\nCarl Juneau\nCEO",

Its main value proposition is that it promises “peace of mind” to customers. It guarantees that if anything goes wrong, it’ll be fixed quickly and won’t cost anything extra over the monthly payments.\nGoals\nLee Preston, a conversion optimization consultant at Worship Digital, analyzed CORGI’s existing Google Analytics data, conducted user testing and heuristic analysis, and used VWO to run on-page surveys and scrollmaps.\nTests run\nAfter conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis, Lee found that:\nUsers were skeptical of CORGI’s competition, believing they were not transparent enough. Part of CORGI’s value proposition is that it doesn’t have any hidden fees so conveying this to users could help convince them to buy.\nOn analyzing the scrollmap results, it was found that only around a third of mobile users scrolled down enough to see the value proposition at the bottom of the product pages.\nThey ran surveys for users and asked, “Did you look elsewhere before visiting this site? (If so, where?)” More than 70% of respondents had looked elsewhere.\nThey ran another survey and asked users what they care about most; 18% of users said “fast service” while another 12% said “reliability.”\nThis is how CORGI’s home page originally looked:\nAfter compiling all these observations, Lee and his team distilled it down to one hypothesis:\nCORGI’s core features were not being communicated properly. Displaying these more clearly on the home page, throughout the comparison journey, and the checkout could encourage more users to sign up rather than opting for a competitor.\nAccording to Lee, “Throughout our user research with CORGI, we found that visitors weren’t fully exposed to the key selling points of the service. This information was available on different pages on the site, but was not present on the pages comprising the main conversion journey.”\nWorship Digital first decided to put this hypothesis to test on the home page.\n“We hypothesized that adding a USP bar below the header would mean 100% of visitors would be exposed to these anxiety-reducing features, therefore, improving motivation and increasing the user conversion rate,” Lee said.\nThis is how the variation looked:\nConclusion\nThe variation performed better than the control across all devices and majority of user types. The variation increased conversions by 30.9%.\nConversion optimization is a continuous process at CORGI. Lee has been constantly running new experiments and gathering deep understanding about the insurance provider’s visitors. For the next phase of testing, he plans to:\nImprove the usability of the product comparing feature.\nIdentify and fix leaks during the checkout process.\nMake complex product pages easier to digest.\nWe were very happy that this A/B test validated our research-driven hypothesis. We loved how we didn’t have to buy some other tool for running heatmaps and scrollmaps for our visitor behavior experiment.\nLee Preston\nCRO Consultant\n(On behalf of CORGI HomePlan)",

They selected VWO for its capabilities, ease of use, and richness of insights provided.\nGoals: Increasing Conversions by Identifying and Eliminating Webpage Elements That Distract Visitors\nMoneYou used VWO tools like heatmaps and clickmaps for its Savings product landing page.\nOn studying the results, the online team analyzed that by removing extra, less-value-adding elements from the page, they could increase engagement, click-through rates (CTRs), and final conversion ratio in terms of the number of people signing up for accounts.\nTests run: A/B Test Helped Validate That Removing Distractions Would Boost CTRs, Engagement, and Conversions\nThe key to the solution lay in identifying those elements on the Savings landing page that distracted visitors and ended up in bounces rather than conversions. The idea was to make sure that the page had enough relevant information to move visitors to the next stage of the funnel, leading to opening of more accounts.\nThe control for the test was the original landing page, which looked like this.\nThe team identified 2 elements as distractions on the original landing page. One was that the letter O in the Dutch word opneembaar was in lower case. The second was the presence of information tabs that the team felt did not serve any purpose.\nA variation, as shown below, was developed. The “O” in “opneembaar” was capitalized, and the extra tabs were removed.\nVariation – Extra tabs removed and clutter trimmed\nConclusion: CTRs, Engagement, and Conversion Increased with More than 95% Confidence\nTracking of CTRs from the “More Information” CTA button (Meer informatie), engagement, and final conversion rate of visitors opening accounts showed amazing results with the variation.\nCTR increased by 7.65% (from 31.62% to 34.04%) with 99% significance.\nEngagement increased by 4.98% (from 38.49% to 40.41%) with 96% significance.\nConversion rate for visitors signing up for saving accounts increased by 14.86% (from 9.69% to 11.13%) with 95+% significance.\nThe most important takeaway from this test was this: Clear the path for visitors looking to buy, and provide them just the required amount of information.\nHere’s a TED talk on how information overload affects decision making.",

Moreover, the platform covers the entire sourcing process, including RFx (request for proposal, request for quote, etc.) processes, simplifying procurement, and vendor selection. It also enables seamless vendor communications and demos.\nWhy VWO\nVWO nails the balance between coding and visual editing. It’s sleek and intuitive.\nFarid Asadi\nConversion & Experimentation Manager\nFarid talks about CRO and all things growth in his blog. You can read it here. \nVWO offers both a Visual Editor and a Code Editor as powerful tools for optimizing web experiences. The Visual Editor is a user-friendly, no-code interface that allows marketers and designers to make real-time changes to a website’s content, layout, and design elements without coding knowledge.\nOn the other hand, the Code Editor in VWO caters to developers and technical experts who prefer to customize experiments and campaigns through coding. Together, these two editors make VWO a platform that accommodates a wide range of users, from non-technical marketers to seasoned developers, in their quest to improve conversion rates.\nGoals\nThe SelectHub website features product pages with comprehensive and detailed content. However, the SelectHub team identified opportunities to enhance user engagement on these pages.\nObservations\nThe initial analysis showed opportunities to improve click activity and scroll depth on product pages. Further, insights obtained from user behavior analysis also indicated room for improvement in call-to-action performance.\nHypothesis\nBased on the observations, SelectHub’s CRO team created the following hypothesis – \nA new navigation system that made the content easily scannable and consumable, and a change in the design of the CTA buttons, would lead to an uplift in engagement and improve purchase conversion rate. \nTests run\nThe CRO team conducted an A/B test on the product pages using VWO Testing. The test ran for just over 4 weeks with desktop traffic divided equally between the control and variation. \nControl\nThe control had an analyst rating and two CTA buttons followed by in-depth information and images of the product to help users understand everything about the product.\nVariation\nThe variation retained the rating but had contrasting colors for the two CTAs. The new navigation system compartmentalized the content by featuring section-wise tabs like overview, pricing, benefits, etc., thus making it easier for visitors to find the necessary information. \nThe test ended with the variation emerging as the clear winner, showing a significant 13.47% improvement in purchases. This improvement had a positive impact on the cash flow.\nConclusion\nSelectHub learned some valuable insights from their A/B test. They found that improving the user experience can not only boost engagement and impact brand perception, it can also elevate conversion rate. They also realized how important it is to study different CTA variations and related user behaviors.\nAdditionally, they discovered that merging their best-performing location with their most effective CTA can produce positive results. These findings underline the importance of experimenting with user experiences and CTAs to improve user engagement and overall performance. \nGrab a 30-day all-inclusive free trial of VWO to experience the comprehensive experimentation capabilities and to understand how you can easily run tests to achieve your business goals.

The companies write and manage over $2 billion in premiums across six states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Known for their exceptional customer service and agent support, the companies have earned an A- (“Excellent”) rating from A.M. Best, a leading independent rating agency in the insurance industry.\nWhy VWO\nPlymouth Rock Assurance has had an outstanding experience with VWO. The tool has been incredibly reliable for us, with no downtime or inconsistencies, making it essential for testing. The support team has been prompt and helpful, ensuring smooth and efficient usage.\nChristopher Allen\nHead of Digital Strategy & Experience Delivery\nGoals\nPlymouth Rock has been using VWO for the past few years to run tests and optimize its website. \nThis particular test was initiated from a product-level strategic decision. The goal was to encourage more customers to download Plymouth Rock’s YUBI® app as part of the insurance policy purchase.\nYUBI stands for Your Usage-Based Insurance, a telematics program Plymouth Rock Assurance offers to customers in the direct sales channel. The app gathers information about driving habits, helping users become smarter and safer drivers.\nObservations\nChristopher and his team monitored the number of days it took customers to install the app after their policy became effective. \nThey believed that the checkout flow’s copy and design lacked appeal and needed improvement to encourage more app downloads.\nHypothesis\nIt was hypothesized that clear messaging and visuals would better highlight the importance of downloading the YUBI app after policy purchase.\nThis was expected to increase the YUBI fulfillment rate compared to the existing flow. The rate is defined as the number of customers who downloaded the app within the qualifying period divided by the total number of customers who purchased a policy. \nThis rate indicated the percentage of customers who downloaded the app after their policy purchase. A higher fulfillment rate would suggest that customers were more engaged and saw value in downloading the app. \nTests run\nThe team had no issues setting up the A/B test using VWO; they chose to run it on the server side. \nThey collaborated with their UX team to develop the screen variations and from then on it was a smooth ride. \nThe changes introduced in the variation were starkly different from the control:\nControl:\nThe final checkout step asked customers to share their mobile numbers to receive a link to download the YUBI app and enjoy the benefits of the YUBI program. However, the message lacked persuasion and context to drive actions.\nVariation:\nThe team implemented important changes to enhance the messaging:\nAdded engaging visuals to capture attention.\nClearly communicated the app’s purpose and benefits.\nBroke down the steps for downloading the app into three simple actions:\nProviding a mobile number\nGranting necessary app permissions\nAvoiding policy cancellation\nHere are the control and variation images for the test. \nWhy server-side testing\nFor running this A/B test, the team chose server-side over client-side to avoid discrepancies in rendering experiences. This is especially critical in finance or insurance, where accuracy is paramount.\nWhen a user raises a quote request, it is considered a dynamic experience because it involves real-time interactions that affect the displayed content. Server-side testing effectively manages these dynamic experiences, ensuring that users receive timely and accurate information. This ensures a consistent experience for all users, as the content is rendered on the server.\nMost importantly, server-side testing ensures that sensitive data remains secure and intact. This minimizes the risk of data loss or corruption that can occur with client-side testing.\nVWO Testing – Server Side features lightweight SDKs in over eight languages for front-end and back-end optimization of key metrics across your tech stack. You can tailor A/B tests to your specific requirements without disrupting the user experience at all. Request a demo to see how it works!\nAnalytics integrations\nAnalytics integrations, including Google Analytics and HEAP, were used to seamlessly integrate test performance metrics into Plymouth Rock’s reporting dashboard suite. This allowed the team to analyze relevant data efficiently within their existing reporting structure.\nTest results\nThis server-side test led to a ~ 10% increase in page over page conversion between YUBI Phone number page and the Checkout page during a 2-week time window. \nConclusion\nThe updated checkout flow, with clearer messaging and visuals, successfully drove more customers to share information for downloading the YUBI app. The test results demonstrated the effectiveness of setting the context upfront, leading to improved engagement and conversion rates. \nVWO is a comprehensive experimentation platform that supports basic to advanced testing across any stack and device, allowing you to track a variety of metrics.

The company used VWO tools to conduct A/B tests aimed at optimizing its website.\nGoals\nFietsPunt set out on the path of A/B testing with the aim of increasing the number of online orders.\nTests run\nThe original homepage looked impressive, clearly displaying key information such as shipping and returns policy right in the top banner. But FietsPunt’s product pages showed a high bounce rate that naturally affected sales adversely.\nThis is how control looked:\nFietsPunt’s owner Roeland Van Oostenbrugge had read another VWO success story in which the client saw a 58% increase in sales by adding a Trust Pilot widget. As he put it, “The inspiration for starting this test came from some VWO cases. It was funny to see another VWO case that was almost similar to this”.\nRoeland felt that visitors were apprehensive about trusting a small and relatively unknown company with online shopping. Having read about the six principles of persuasion posited in Robert Cialdini’s classic book ‘Influence’, Roeland decided to conduct an A/B test with a variation that included a Facebook widget on the product pages that showed more than 1,000 “Likes”. This, he believed, would constitute “social proof” for visitors to the website.\nThe test was set up and run using the VWO platform. Half the traffic was directed to the original page, and the other half to the variation. This is how the variation with the Facebook widget looked:\nHowever, the test didn’t seem to have much impact on user behavior, because the problem of bounce persisted. He tested another variation where the widget was placed at a different location- but that did not change the situation either.\nAn undeterred Roeland, who believed that his hypothesis of providing social proof was right (but the way he was doing so was not), selected another tool from the credibility arsenal- a TrustPilot widget that showed the latest customers reviews. This test too was set up and run on the VWO platform. He tracked “add to carts” and “sales”. The A/B test aimed to test if live customer testimonials helped allay visitors’ anxiety and boosted trust (and hence sales).\nThe widget was added on the bottom right corner of the page. This is what the variation looked like:\nThe test was run for 15 days on around 16,000 visitors before Roeland decided to implement the changes on the website.\nConclusion\nThe version with the Trust Pilot recorded a 36.73% increase in orders and had a 99% chance to beat the original.\nWhen asked how he expects the increase in orders to impact revenue, Roeland said, “I assume the turnover to grow linearly with the conversion rate. In that case, our monthly extra revenue would be approximately 90,000 Euros ($122,660).”\nIt is interesting to note that the same underlying persuasion principle of ‘social proof’ delivered such widely-varying results in the two tests. The Facebook widget showing “likes” didn’t make any difference to conversions whereas the TrustPilot widget showing customer testimonials did have a major impact. It is unfair to directly compare the two tests as they were run several months apart. Nonetheless, it is useful to understand why the variation with customer reviews worked better.\nWe believe there was a difference because the TrustPilot widget provided greater reassurance to visitors and prospects. Some 63% of consumers say they are more likely to purchase from a site if it has product ratings and reviews. Around 70% of online shoppers in US say they look at product reviews before making a purchase. The TrustPilot widget displayed reviews by customers who had already made the purchase. This assured prospects that other people were actually buying the products, thereby removing the last barrier for conversion to take place.",

Its products are available for purchase in Hungary, Germany, Austria, and Serbia.\nGoals\nAs a Hungarian company, the brand faced customer trust issues in markets such as in Germany. Their main goal was to improve the number of clicks on Add to Cart CTA button by developing increased customer confidence. They aimed to do this by adding third-party product test certifications and internationally-recognized payment icons through A/B testing.\nTests run\nThe company wanted its website to develop increased customer confidence by adding third-party product test certifications and internationally-recognized payment icons.\nThis is what control looked like:\nThe team at Manna hypothesized that adding the product quality certification logos and payment icons near the Add to Cart CTA button on the product page would increase clicks on the button and hence sales. The team decided to A/B test the original (control) against two variations.\nThe first version had a big banner showing the payment icons in one row and 3 product test certification logos just below. This is what variation 1 looked like:\nThe banner in the second version showed 2 rows of various product test certificates; there were no payment icons. This is what variation 2 looked like:\nUsing the VWO platform, the test was run on more than 3,000 visitors, split equally between the 3 versions. The goal tracked was the number of clicks on Add to Cart CTA button.\nConclusion\nVariation 1 beat both the original (control) and Variation 2. 11.26% of the visitors who viewed this version, clicked the Add to Cart button. The figures for variation 2 and the control were respectively 8.73% and 1.48%. Here’s a screenshot of the VWO app-generated bar graph that shows conversion rates for the control and the 2 variations.\nAs always, it is instructive to go behind the data to understand what caused the evident changes in customer behavior.\nGiven its age and provenance, the Manna brand could not rely only on product quality and great product pages on its website to sell. It needed to reiterate product authenticity, something that both variations helped do. That this was important to buyers was borne out by the fact that variation 2 recorded a 490% increase in the click rate.\nBut buyers also needed to be reassured that they could purchase the product by using payment options they were comfortable with and were well-known for their data protection and privacy practices. Variation 1 offered payment safety assurance along with product authenticity/quality assurance. Not surprisingly, this variation performed the best.",

They aggregate job listings from thousands of websites, including employment boards, recruitment firms, associations, and company career pages.\nThe goal of the website is to provide easy access for job seekers to find jobs ranging from temporary employment to complex project services, personnel consulting to headhunting, career management and lots more.\nGoals\nImpegio’s primary objective was to drive leads, increase conversions and boost engagement for the brand.\nObservations\nBack in 2017, Gennaro Augurio, Commercial Manager at Impegio noticed that although the company was driving a huge amount of traffic to their homepage, only a small percentage of those people were actually subscribing to the website.\nSensing the need to increase user retention and drive user loyalty, Gennaro and his team started exploring marketing channels which could help them create brand stickiness. In the process they stumbled upon VWO Engage.\nTests run\nAfter integrating VWO Engage with Impegio’s website, Gennaro and his team finished installing the VWO Smartcode and sent out their first push notification. Within a few minutes, Impegio’s website saw an astounding 200% increase in their traffic, which also helped them gain their first set of 120 subscribers!\nSince Impegio’s primary goal was to help people find suitable jobs, Gennaro and his team mainly sent push notifications about new job alerts, job recommendations, recruitment drives, HR conferences, etc. By employing a combination of VWO Engage’s audience segmentation feature, they were able to send relevant push messages based on a user’s interest.\nAs a practice, Impegio also constantly monitors their push notifications using VWO Engage’s reporting dashboard.\nUpon asking Gennaro about his experience, he quoted, “The VWO Engage dashboard is like our holy grail for push notifications. It gives us insights on how our customers interact with push notifications and allows us to further optimize them for better results.”\nPut in perspective, push notifications have a significant cumulative impact on customer retention.\nConclusion\nAt the moment Impegio gets an average click rate of 15% from their push notifications, which is astounding if you compare it with the open rate for emails which is as low as 2-3%. Their all time highest click rate for notifications has been a whopping 45%.\nSince their notifications are extremely personalized and targeted, they’re usually successful in enticing subscribers to their homepage, resulting in an average session time of 3 minutes, thereby increasing Impegio’s credibility in Google’s search engine.\nPush Notification Tips by Gennaro\nWe asked Gennaro to share some push notification tips for fellow marketers. Here’s what he had to say, “There’s a thin line between engaging your audience and being intrusive. We did a lot of A/B testing with our push messages, experimented with content, colors, images and timing. Our key tip would be to avoid sending more than two push messages in a day.”\nImpegio typically sends over 5-6 push notifications over a span of 5 days.",

The testing could be in the form of adding a call to action button when original design didn’t have one, testing a different one or even in the form of different text for each call to action buttons.\nConsolidated Label manufactures custom printed labels for retail products in a variety of markets, including Food, Beverage, Health & Beauty, and Health markets. They have segmented their services in 4 broad categories—Printing, Art, Quality, and Systems. They used VWO to A/B test a new design with a prominent call to action button.\nGoals\nTheir original web design did not have any call to action buttons, so they tried A/B testing a new CTA on one of their product pages.\nTests run\nThis is how the Food Labels section appeared on one of their product pages.\nControl\nIn the middle of the description, they added a CTA titled Instant Online Quote.\nThis is how the variation appeared:\nResult: The variation with the call to action button titled Instant Online Quote increased conversions by 62%.\nConclusion\nOn asking what lessons they learnt from testing, this is what Tracy Gamlin of Consolidated Label had to say:\n“Make your desired conversion goal obvious, but harmonious to the rest of the design. Also, giving people a few places on a page to get to the conversion accommodates different types of users. For example, the people who just want to get a quote get their button at the top of the page, whereas people who need more substantiation get the opportunity to quote further down the page after they’ve read more copy/seen more images.“\nIf you still haven’t started A/B testing, now is a good time to give VWO a try, with unlimited simultaneous tests.\nWe’ve found VWO to be immensely valuable for all of our testing needs.  Ultimately, it confirms our feelings with actual data – and many times it even surprises us!\nTracy Gamlin\nWeb Marketing Manager",

        "raw_contents": "About ClickLab\nClickLab is a Brazilian agency specializing in Conversion Rate Optimization, and they used VWO to test a radical redesign of the primary page on WriteWork.com, a popular essay website for students.\nGoals\nThe traffic was nearly exclusively organic, and the page was struggling with high bounce rates for a while. The objective was to increase engagement and get more people further down the funnel (which ultimately led to an increase in purchases).\nObservations\nA key challenge was how to go about testing the new design. Everything about it was different, from the header to the footer. This meant a user might land on the home page, which has one look, then click on to the redesigned page, which has a different look.\nTests run\nLuckily, the above challenge was easily solved by using VWO. As the primary objective was to increase engagement on the landing page, the following segmentation trick was used:\nBy restricting the test to only the visitors landing on the page, engagement could be measured without having to worry about the design not being consistent throughout the site.\nThe original page didn’t communicate what the benefits of the service are. Following is how the original design, or control, looked like:\nAfter reviewing over 1,000 survey responses, it became clear what the real benefits were and then these benefits were communicated much more directly in the variation. Next, social proof and various credibility indicators were introduced.\nHere is how the variation looked like:\nA/B Test Results\nThe result of the A/B test was that the engagement more than doubled. One important thing to note is that engagement in VWO measures only clicks and not submissions of forms, for example, using a search form (for this reason, searches were measured separately).\nThe great thing about VWO is that you can measure multiple goals. This meant that it’s possible to see exactly where the engagement was happening – the biggest increase was indeed the clicks on the CTA. The 4 top buttons accounted for less 1% in engagement increase.\nThe secondary objective was to get users to click the primary CTA; and here, results increased by 144%.\nThis meant that more than twice as many people continued on to the payment page. More payment page views don’t automatically mean more purchases, but a follow-up test showed that purchases went up by over 50%.\nConclusion\nAlthough the results were fantastic, they weren’t that surprising. After going over the surveys from users, it became so clear that the original did a terrible job at selling the service.\nWhat allowed them these fantastic results was that they started with the users in mind; doing everything they could to understand him/her—understand their wants, their worries, and their needs.\nThey also looked closely at the language used on the website. For example, WriteWork has always used the expression “overcome writer’s block,” but no users used these words. Instead, users wanted to hear “get started” and “get inspiration.” So, now they use that language on the website.\nJens Schriver from ClickLab gave VWO a nice, short testimonial:\nIt was a breeze to set up this A/B test and segment it. We’ve used Google Website Optimizer many times in the past, but – if we can avoid it – we are not going back ?\nJens Schriver\nFounder",

        "raw_contents": "About Hyundai\nIn the Netherlands, Hyundai hired Traffic4U, an experienced, international online marketing agency that specializes in result-driven online marketing, to optimize conversion rates from their lead-generation pages (leading to test drives). Traffic4u is a VWO-certified partner. Being familiar with the powerful capabilities of VWO, they chose it for testing and optimization on Hyundai.nl.\nThis success story describes how Traffic4U used VWO and was able to achieve a 62% increase in conversion rates for Hyundai.\nGoals\nIncrease Conversions in the Form of Visitors Requesting Test Drives\nHyundai has landing pages for all of its car models where people can request a test drive or download a brochure. These landing pages mainly get traffic from paid advertising campaigns (but get some direct and SEO traffic too). Hyundai wanted to make the most of this traffic.\nSpecifically, the company had 3 goals:\nIncrease the number of brochure requests and/or requests for test drives.\nIncrease click-throughs from the landing page of the specific car model to the first step of the funnel.\nMeasure engagement (inverse of the bounce rate).\nTests run\nMultivariate Testing Helped Identify the Benefits from Specific Changes\nThe main difference between A/B testing and multivariate testing is that in an A/B test, multiple changes are made to a single variation while in multivariate testing, every change made creates a new variation that is tested. So, multivariate testing is useful when there are multiple ideas to test on a page, as it tells you exactly which changes impact your conversion rates and which don’t. Take a free trial to see how it works!\nTraffic4U decided to conduct a multivariate test on each car page on Hyundai.nl, because\nHyundai’s car landing pages had a lot of different elements (car headline, car visuals, description, testimonials, and others). A multivariate test would help understand which elements influenced a visitor’s decision to request a test drive or download a brochure.\nTraffic4U set up a multivariate test and decided to create variations of the following sections of the page:\nNew (SEO friendly) text versus control text: The hypothesis was that if a change from normal text to SEO-friendly text did not impact conversion rates, the change could be permanently implemented for SEO benefits.\nExtra call to action buttons versus no extra buttons: The hypothesis was that an extra call to action button highlighted a desired action and would nudge visitors in that direction.\nLarge photo of the car versus thumbnails: The hypothesis was that larger photographs would attract visitors and also help them confirm that they are on the right page. A total of 8 combinations (3 sections, 2 variations each = 2*2*2) were generated for this multivariate test.\nHere’s a screenshot of the original page:\nTraffic4U was spot on with all 3 changes. The results of this multivariate test were phenomenal. The variation with SEO text, extra buttons, and larger images increased conversion rates (request for test drive or brochure) by 62%. And there was a staggering 208% increase in click-through rates (step 1 to step 2).\nHere’s what the winning variation looked like:\nThe outcomes of the optimization based on this multivariate test were so impressive that this test won the silver in the annual WhichTestWon awards!\nConclusion\nVWO Features Helped Hyundai Achieve 62% Increase in Leads\nObjectivity is a clear benefit from using a hypothesis-based approach with an appropriate application (such as VWO). Adding the SEO text may have impacted traffic a little; but in this case, any such decrease was more than offset by the gains made by the other changes. Rather than guessing your way through, setting up a multivariate test can easily help you choose the preferred course. VWO’s advanced Multivariate Testing capabilities help you configure tests with a wide range of options. Take a free trial to checkout for yourself!\nTraffic4U used heuristics and drew upon their experience of best practices to come up with variations for this test (for example, larger pictures and clear call to action buttons). A\nwell-conducted multivariate test also helps validate best practices for future use.\nThis is what Janco Klijnstra from Traffic4U had to say about VWO:\nVWO is very valuable. It made it possible for us as an agency to build our own variations, test on a group of pages and measure different goals at once. Also the Analytics plug-in was very helpful in the analysis for segmentation purposes.\nJanco Klijnstra\nProduct Manager, CRO\n(On behalf of Hyundai)",

The affiliate’s traffic was all organic, and they had banners and text links sending visitors to the landing page.\nTests run\nTheir original landing page had a Screenshots section and an FAQs section.\nHere’s how it looked:\nOriginal page\nThe variations we tried were simply removing each of these sections in turn and then removing both sections together, so there were three variations in total.\nIn the first variation, they removed the FAQs section.\nWithout FAQs: 62% increase in Sales\nSplit-testing is always surprising! That’s half the fun of it. The result was a 62% improvement by just removing the FAQ section.\nIn the second variation, they removed the screenshots section.\nWithout Screenshots: 56% increase in Sales\nHowever, what happens if you remove too much content from the landing page?\nOut of curiosity, AssessmentDay then went one step further and deleted both sections of the page, but this proved too much and the conversion rate actually dropped by about 3%.\nHere’s how this variation looked like:\nWithout FAQs and Screenshot: 3% Decrease in Sales\nConclusion\nWhen we asked if there were any lessons that AssessmentDay learnt from this test, here’s what they said:\nLess is more, up to a point. It’s surprising how you can spend so much time deliberating over the content of a sales page when in fact that section of content actually puts people off and you’re better without it.\nSplit URL testing wins out over gut feel almost every time.\nThey also had great things to say about the split URL testing tool they used:\n  “VWO has been extremely valuable, not to mention fun to use. The service has paid for itself several times over.“\n  This was an exciting test with unexpected results.

In 2007, they launched their business out of a rented garden shed which they remodelled into a mini warehouse.\nFrom these humble origins, the company has grown incredibly quickly, year on year, to become the leading seller of whole foods, health foods, and superfoods in the UK and the rest of Europe. Arthur, an industry veteran with over two decades of experience in whole foods, still oversees the supply and selection of all the fresh and organic produce they offer.\nGoals\nIn 2015, Becky, the Marketing Director at the company, was exploring new channels of communication to bring customers back to their website. Impressed with the instant and simple nature of push notifications, she decided to give VWO Engage a try.\nTests run\nBuy Whole Foods Online is one of VWO Engage’s earliest adopters and possibly one of the early adopters of the technology of push notifications for websites. They tested out different time durations, messages, and offers to trigger the opt-in prompt. Here’s how it appears on BuyWholeFoodsOnline.com’s mobile website:\nTheir first notification offered a 17% discount on one of their best-selling products- Ecover Non Bio Washing Powder. The notification was delivered to 736 subscribers of whom 49  clicked through and reached the product page, with an overwhelming majority of them completing the purchase.\n“Using push notifications, we can guide them better to a specific page on our website which they otherwise may not find. We can fulfil their personal preferences better,” observed Becky.\nSo far, their most popular notification that sent subscribers into frenzy has been this tempting offer on Coconut Water.\nThe notification received a click rate of 15.2%. Out of the 97 people that reached the product page after clicking on the notification, 71 actually made a purchase. Not just that, this one notification helped them clock a 3-digit revenue. When people were on the website, apart from the coconut water which was on offer, they also browsed through other products – adding them to their cart, to qualify for free shipping.\nFor this notification, we encouraged them to add the word “CLICK” explicitly, as it imparted a clear call to action to the notification. The notification didn’t just mention what was on offer but also instructed how subscribers can get the offer.\nConclusion\nWith the help of VWO Engage, Buy Whole Foods Online was able to reengage their users. Whenever a product was on discount or offer, pushing a notification about it, brought them back.\nBecky now aims to test and come up with the best time for sending notifications, and also optimise their copy to get the best click rate possible.\nAccording to Beckey:\n“Using VWO Engage, we fulfil our users’ personal preferences better by guiding them to relevant pages on the website.“",

        "raw_contents": "About SafeSoft Solutions\nSafeSoft Solutions is an industry-leading provider of multichannel marketing automation software. It develops a range of products for customer contact centers.\nA fairly common situation faced by eCommerce website owners everywhere is whether or not to clearly display the prices of what they’re selling. Displaying the price (along with the product or service features) would allow visitors to judge immediately whether they want to buy or not.\nFrom a usability standpoint, it’s a highly efficient process. However, if you’re trying to get the visitor to engage with you, intuition says that after they have all the information they need, it’s either a 1 or a 0; a buy or a don’t buy. There’s no 0.5 in between where the business can talk to the visitor and help them make up their mind.\nThis is where A/B testing comes handy. It has an interesting tendency to walk-in, smash intuition right out of the window, and leave the concerned people feeling pleasantly surprised.\nGoals\nIn September 2011, SafeSoft Solutions ran a PPC campaign for their Market Dialer product, looking to generate leads through a contact form. They faced a decision whether or not to include the pricing for Market Dialer at a prominent place on the landing page.\nTests run\nLike any smart marketer, SafeSoft Solutions A/B tested price display next to the form.\nThis is how the original form looked:\nControl\nThe variation included a large green image with the price.\nConclusion\nThe result: a 100% jump in leads generated. This took SafeSoft by surprise, but they found that displaying the price makes the offer more attractive to their customers.\nLessons from This Test\nIt’s hypothetical, but this is what we think. It’s likely that the features provided by the product were relevant to the visitors, but they weren’t submitting their details, because they already had a competing product in mind and wanted to avoid talking to another sales/marketing person.\nThe visitors who saw the variation with the price image decided that the value provided was good for the asking price and were happy to provide their details. Therefore, this should work most where the price (for a similar set of features) is competitive.\nAbout VWO, the tool they used to set up and run the test, Nima Hakimi of SafeSoft said it was “extremely useful.”\nWhat do you think is the best way for SafeSoft to test this hypothesis of ours? Please tell us (and SafeSoft) in the comments. Also, share any similar or contrary experiences you might have had with price displays.",

        "raw_contents": "About Morningstar Properties\nEstablished in 1981, Morningstar Properties is a developer, owner, and operator of real estate products focused on self-storage and marinas. With its corporate headquarters in Charlotte, NC, the company manages a network of marinas under the name Morningstar Marinas. \nMorningstar Marinas has created a community of boaters who come together to enjoy life on the water. They work quickly and efficiently to help customers get out on the water, so they can start boating and start having fun as soon as possible. With clubhouse facilities and picnic areas, clean bathhouse facilities, restaurants, fuel, fish cleaning stations, and ship’s stores, Morningstar Marinas is more than just a place to store your boat—it’s a boating experience you’ll never forget. \nMorningstar uses VWO for their experimentation needs. We spoke to Alexandra, Digital Marketing Manager at Morningstar Properties, and discussed the team’s experience with a recently conducted successful A/B test.\nGoal\nThe team wanted to improve the number of inquiries sent via the form on their mobile website. This form was accessible via a CTA above the main navigation bar. It was hypothesized that changing the copy of the CTA would positively impact the number of clicks on it and, in turn, also increase the number of form submissions. (VWO’s GPT-3.5 Turbo-powered AI copy generator provides a large set of copy suggestions based on the existing copy on your website. You can test out what works the best for your audience with the platform’s quick experimentation capabilities. Take a free trial to find out how.)\nTests run\nThe team experimented with two variations of the existing CTA which said ‘Contact Us. In variation 1, the copy was changed to ‘Inquire Now’ and in variation 2, the copy was changed to ‘Store Your Boat’.\nThis is how the control and variations looked in the mobile navigation:\nThe test was concluded in nearly 3 months and Variation 1 was declared the smart winner by VWO. It led to a 44.11% increase in clicks to CTA which was the primary goal of the experiment. Variation 1 also performed the best on the second goal which was the number of inquiry form submissions. Here it reported an uplift of 15.43% over control. \nConclusion\nWith the test for the mobile navigation CTA being successful, the team is also testing the CTA on their desktop website using VWO. One of their learnings from the mobile navigation test has been around testing relatively minor, but the right changes. It isn’t always necessary to test radical ideas – this test has shown the team how minor changes to CTAs around the website can have a big impact and encourage experimenters to think about what the users of their website are looking for.",

        },
        "raw_contents": "About Billund Airport\nBillund Airport, West Denmark’s International Airport’s team used VWO to help figure out what would help drive traffic to the shopping page of their web site.\nGoals\nThe main objective behind undertaking A/B testing for their homepage was to drive more visitors to explore their online shopping page.\nTests run: CTA text modified so that it conveys value more effectively to visitors- and thus attracts them\nThe airport’s website had five call-to-action buttons that pretty much consumed all the real estate on their homepage. These CTAs were Book Tickets, Book Parking, Arrive Home, Shop Online and Questions and Answers. This is how the site originally looked:\nTo get more customers to enter their shopping page, the company decided to create a variation of the fourth CTA button (“Shopping”) and A/B test it against the control (the original page). The text ‘Shop Online’ was replaced by the text ‘Buy Tax-Free’. VWO was used to set up and run the test. The test ran for 17 days.\nThis is the screenshot of the variation (the original was in Danish; this is an English translation using Google Translate):\nConclusion: A 49.85% increase in the number of visitors clicking on the Shopping page\nThe hypothesis was spot on. The variation won hands down, with the variation generating 49.85 more clickthroughs than the control. The clincher was that there was a 99% confidence associated with the results, meaning that the variation would perform better than the original 99 times out of hundred. Not surprisingly, Billund Airport executed the changes.\nAs conversion optimization specialists, we are always looking to understand why something worked- and tie the learnings to web design principles or other underpinnings in consumer behaviour, neurosciences etc.\nSo why did this small change deliver big results?\nIt’s all about phrasing the CTA in a way that conveys value to the visitor. The original text ‘Shop Online’ just stated the obvious; it didn’t do anything extra. It’s a bad value proposition. By comparison, the phrase ‘Buy Tax-Free’ has multiple advantages. Here are some of them:\n1) Desirable value proposition\nA business or marketing statement that summarizes why a consumer should buy a product or use a service.\nIf one is to go by this definition of value proposition, then ‘Buy Tax Free’ knocks it out of the park. It effortlessly conveys a clear benefit to potential shoppers which a ‘Shop Online’ can’t even hope to communicate – a strategy that also finds a mention in Content Verve’s 10 success story takeaways. By announcing on its homepage that it offers duty-free products, it is telling international flyers that shopping with them could yield substantial savings.\n2) Competitive advantage\nVisitors like to compare. Unless and until you have done something remarkable to make them love you, they will scour the length and breadth of internet (not possible, but tempting usage of the phrase) to find the best price, offer or whatever instant gratification they are looking for.\nBillund Airport’s variation copy told international travelers exactly why shopping at Billund Airport was a better deal than buying from local stores. The ‘duty-free’ part gains it a competitive edge over other shops or eCommerce stores that might be selling similar products. For instance, this Shiseido Benefiance night cream displayed on Billund’s category page was priced at 500 DKK. The same cream was being sold for 640 DKK at Matas store, a prominent drugstore chain that operates across Denmark.\n3) The word “free”\nBillund Airport was only offering buyers the benefit of lower taxes; they were not giving anything out for free. But “free” is that endorphin-inducing word that makes shoppers go weak in the knees. From behavioral economists, neuro marketers to copywriting experts – everyone has vouched for the power of free.",

        "raw_contents": "About Beamax\nBeamax, a Netherlands-based company, manufactures and distributes projection screens for home cinemas and meeting rooms world-wide. Beamax Screens has upgraded from an all range supplier of projection screens, being a one stop shop, now offering a range of projection screens meeting latest requirements for the Pro-AV and Home-AV market.\nGoals\nThe Beamax team wanted visitors on the home page to go to a site dedicated to ex-demo and one-off items that are sold directly to consumers. (All other screens are sold indirectly through resellers). They wanted to clear up some space in the warehouse that was taken up by uncommon items.\nTests run\nJust above the product images on the home page, they put a standard link promoting the other website. It said:\nGreat deals on brand new and ex-demo screens here\nTo increase click-throughs to the link, they tested a red link (with the same text), because they felt it would outperform the standard blue that they used. Plus, it’s something direct marketers use in “real” mail pieces too.\nAs another variation, they transformed the link into something banner-like that they thought would even have more impact. Their hypothesis was that the banner version the sure-fire winner. See the screenshots below:\nOriginal Page - Control\nVariation 1 - Page with the Red Link\nVariation 2 - Page with the Red Banner\nSo, any guesses on which version got maximum clicks: the blue, red, or banner version? The red link and banner both outperformed the blue link and that wasn’t a surprise. But the eye-opening result was the red link winning from the banner.\nThe improvement of red link compared to the original blue link was quite significant: 53.13%.\nConclusion\nOtto Tromm, CEO of Beamax, stresses the importance of waiting for statistically significant results. He said:\n“In the early stage of the test, the banner was the big winner. But, over time (when the results got more reliable), the red link outperformed the banner. That taught me not to jump to conclusions.\nAnd it was tempting to declare an early winner, because initial results proved my gut feeling. The test proved me wrong, so it teaches you to stay humble too.\nSo would I implement a red link vs a banner blindly next time? No, I would test it!“\nChoice of the right tool is certainly important when are you are doing A/B tests. Beamax chose VWO for the test (just like thousands of other businesses).\nVWO made it easy for a non-tech guy to do the tests and keep our designer and programmer focused on their own projects. With Google’s solution, it was a lot more work to implement tests, which is why I stopped using it. Just couldn’t get it all done myself, which is important when you have an idea and quickly want it implemented.\nOtto Tromm\nCEO",

A similar instance of this was witnessed by Dutchento, one of the VWO customers.\nDutchento is the official Dutch community for Magento CMS, ran by Guido Jansen, a Magento specialist.\nGoals\nThe goal of this A/B test was to increase subscriptions for Dutchento’s newsletter and RSS subscription.\nTests run\nThe call-to-action for subscription is located in a box on all pages of the site. See the control version of subscription box below and note that there is no explicit incentive for a visitor to subscribe:\nControl\nGuido tested a variation of this subscription box which included a title and some benefits in a bullet list. Here is his hypothesis for increasing subscriptions:\nPeople don’t just subscribe to a newsletter or newsfeed for nothing, you should convince them it has added value above just visiting the website. So what I wanted to test is if adding convincing reasons to subscribe would increase the newsletter and newsfeed subscription rate. I measured the impact of the convincing reasons on clicks on both the newsletter and newsfeed links.\nHere is how his variation (of subscription box) looks like:\nVariation\nConclusion\nAs expected, Guido saw a significant improvement of 190.31% in the newsletter click rate. However, the newsfeed click rate decreased (–44.46%) which did surprise him (and us!).\nHe expected that the convincing reasons would affect both positively, but apparently, it had a negative effect on newsfeed clicks.\nThe reason why clicks on newsfeed decreased is not clear, but we believe that the benefits in the variation were so compelling that visitors chose to get the blog updates via email (where they will be sure to read them) rather than the RSS reader (where they may miss them). A great way to get more insight into this would be to randomize the position of newsfeed/newsbrief to eliminate the positional effect of those links.\nGuido used VWO for A/B testing, and here is what he had to say:\nVWO was very valuable [for testing]. It’s the easiest A/B and Multivariate testing tool I know. It’s great not to be dependent on the development department to create and run your tests.\nGuido Jansen\nFounder",

Its products are designed by an orthopedic hand specialist for superior ergonomics, grip and comfort. The company sells its products online.\nThe company hired Portland-based marketing & conversion optimization agency, Sq1, to optimize the website and increase sales from their eCommerce store. Sq1 is a VWO certified partner that uses the VWO platform extensively in its work with different clients.\nGoals: Increase online revenue\nSq1 performed many tests on the Bionic Gloves website using the VWO platfom. Based on the test results, several elements of the website were changed. This case is focused on an interesting test that was performed on one of the most important pages of any eCommerce website, the shopping cart page.\nOne study by Surepayroll estimated that each year eCommerce websites lose a whopping $18 billion because of shopping cart abandonment. Clearly, cart abandonment is a major challenge for online retailers- Bionic Gloves included.\nThis is what the original shopping cart page looked like:\nTests run: A/B testing can help validate optimization opportunities that seemingly defy conventional wisdom- like removing gift card/special offer code boxes\nSq1 believed that reducing cart abandonment would boost completed conversions and hence, sales. They hypothesized that removing the ‘special offer’ and ‘gift card’ code boxes from the shopping cart page would reduce cart abandonment. This was rather counter-intuitive, and A/B tests were the only way to establish the validity of their hypothesis.\nThey set up an A/B test on the VWO platform. The variation was tested on close to 1400 visitors for a duration of 48 days. The primary goal tracked was revenue. This is a screenshot of what the variation page (without the code fields) looked like:\nConclusion: Total revenue increased by almost 25%; revenue per visitor too spiked by 17%\nThe tests proved the hypothesis. The variation (without the “gift card” and “special offer”) actually increased total revenue by a whopping 24.7%. Revenue per visitor too went up by a substantial 17.1%.\nUnderstanding what happened and why is perhaps the most fascinating and gratifying part of A/B testing and conversion optimization. Explaining the results, David from Sq1 said, “Anytime you leave the door open for a user to leave the conversion funnel – even if it seems like they’d come right back – you risk losing sales. By showing the Promo Code field on the cart, users were enticed to leave the site in search of a promo code. At that point, the conversion process is interrupted and you are more likely to lose potential customers. As such, hiding it was a very logical test.”\nIf you are an avid online shopper, chances are that you too have displayed similar behavior. Right in the middle of the purchasing process, you spot a box asking for a discount/coupon code and off you go trying to find one. As David pointed out, this tendency creates a number of risks for online stores:\nThe sight of a coupon box triggers visitors to look for one on Google and other places. Here’s what a quick Google search of “Bionic Glove” revealed (in the auto-complete searches):\neCommerce websites risk losing money to affiliates and websites offering deals, coupons etc. because visitors may end up finding a better deal on another online store.\nA smart way of dealing with this challenge is to offer a discount and show the relevant codes right on the product page and also on the cart/payment page. Depending on how the store structures its discount schemes, this approach could even help increase average order value by encouraging buyers to buy more things (e.g. to get to the threshold at which coupons can be applied).\nMyntra, a fashion eCommerce website based out of India, is a great example of this:",

Using VWO, they ran a simple A/B test to see how these icons impacted sales.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nUnderstanding Quran Academy VWO Success Story Variation\nThe test ran for 11 days.\nConclusion: 32.57% Increase in Sales\nThe hypothesis was proved, with the variation generating 32.57% more sales than the control. The results had a statistical significance of 98%.\nAs conversion optimization specialist Maruf Yusupov, representing UnderstandQuran.com, said, “I have seen many other cases where highlighting risk-free Guarantee icons worked so I wanted to try on this company too.”\nThe 30-day Money Back Guarantee icon convinced more prospects to sign up by allaying potential customers’ fears regarding the purchase; it eliminated one of the biggest barriers to conversions—perceived risk. While the Guarantee icon took care of a potential customer’s skepticism, the Apple Store icon assured prospects (at least those with iPhones) that they could access content even on the move—a convenience benefit.\nThere are 2 takeaways from this test that can be called best practices:\n1) Say it out loud.\nNo matter how hard-to-resist your discount offer or how compelling your value proposition is, it means nothing unless your customers are aware of it. The Money-back Guarantee and App features were already part of the text on the sign-up page.\nBut as Maruf Yusupov said, “We wanted to test if there is a positive impact if we highlight them. It seems there is.”\n2) Display it prominently.\nIf you have decided what value elements you want to highlight and how, place these at a strategic position on the page to attract maximum eyeballs.\nUnderstandQuran.com placed the icons in a way that these did not disrupt the natural eye flow. They made the icons larger than the call-to-actions (though not a best practice), which ensured that visitors see the guarantee icon before the call-to-action buttons. Also, the orange color of the Guarantee icon stood out in contrast to the green color of the CTAs and was hard to miss.",

        "raw_contents": "About Klickkonzept\nKlickkonzept is a Germany-based, online-marketing-performance agency. It excels in services like SEO, SEA, CRO, social media, and e-mail marketing. With the vision of building a 360-degree online marketing concept, it helps its clients in boosting their website KPIs. Klickkonzept firmly believes that all online marketing practices go hand in hand.\nThis success story is with reference to one of its eCommerce clients, point-rouge.\nKlickkonzept made a couple of important observations per the data collected from Google Analytics and a usability test done by them. The data highlighted a high cart abandonment rate and a high bounce rate contributing to a low conversion rate.\nAll these observations helped Klickkonzept understand where the leakage was happening in point-rouge’s conversion funnel. It used these insights and observations to craft the absolute conversion rate optimization (CRO) approach and test it with the VWO Experimentation Platform™.\nWith AdWords and price comparison websites being the major traffic sources, point-rouge’s conversion rate was lower than expected. As Klickkonzept team digged in deeper, it noticed:\nA high number of abandoned carts\nA high bounce rate on product pages\nThe data from Google Analytics also highlighted that visitors with higher session duration tend to convert more.\nGoals\nBased on the observations and the current conversion rate, the Klickkonzept team was able to identify the following challenges they needed to address:\nNot having a clear proposition on the website\nLess understanding about website visitors\nGiving more preference to assumption over data and missing out on CRO as a\ndata-driven process\nThe primary goal was to build a comprehensive understanding around the website visitors, their onsite behavior, and the pattern they follow to convert. It was necessary to identify the elements that were preventing the visitors from purchasing a product.\nAs point-rouge is an eCommerce store, Klickkonzept decided to focus on improving user experience on high-potential pages, that is, the home page, product pages, and the checkout page.\nThe Klickkonzept team also wanted to leverage this information to improve point-rouge’s KPIs such as the bounce rate, session duration, and conversion rate.\nTests run\nKlickkonzept conducted a “Usability-Testessen” (Testessen= Testdinner) test where they asked a bunch of people to purchase a product from point-rouge’s website and share inputs regarding their experience as a new visitor.\nBesides, they ran an on-site survey targeting all the website visitors. This survey was conducted across all the website pages.\nAfter consolidating all the responses, it was clear that point-rouge had low brand awareness. Visitors did not have sufficient information about point-rouge and its products. The proposition was not being clearly communicated.\nThough the following 3 USPs were mentioned at some places, but these did not have the right positioning to engage the visitors:\n90-day return policy\nFree gift wrap\nFree shipping after the second order\nThe team outlined the solution as follows:\nA “Usability Testessen” (Testessen= Testdinner) test to understand a new visitor’s experience while making a purchase.\nLeverage VWO to identify the best position for brand’s USPs, and then ensure that visitors get to access the relevant information faster.\nHypothesis\nTo increase awareness and build trust for the brand, it was necessary to have clear communication around point-rouge’s propositions.\nAfter compiling all the observations from their research, Maurice and his team drilled down to the below hypothesis:\n“If we put the 3 most important USPs and highlight that visitors can avail free shipping after their second order, the conversion rate will increase by 10%.”\nThe team created this hypothesis on its VWO dashboard and based on the relevancy score, began the test.\nTest\nTo find out the best position for the USPs, the team tried a different variation with VWO as its CRO platform. They decided to have this information on the Header bar to ensure that visitors get to access the relevant information faster.\nThe test was run for 3 weeks for all desktop visitors.\nHere’s the original home page screen:\nHere’s the screenshot (close-up) of the Control:\nHere’s the screenshot (close-up) of the Variation. Note the USPs added to the header bar:\nConclusion\nThe variation performed better than the control across majority of visitor types. As a result, it facilitated to increase the conversions rate for point-rouge by 7.12%, contributing towards the revenue boost by 19.24%.\nKlickkonzept believes that the variation won because visitors got all the relevant information they needed to make a purchase.",

Every purchase made at GoodwillFinds provides support to Goodwill career centers and social enterprises across North America. By selling donated items, GoodwillFinds prevents them from going into landfills and promotes a sustainable environment. \nWhy VWO\nThis was the first experiment we made live with VWO and we find the platform to have a broad range of capabilities and relatively easy to use for non-technical staff.\nJim Davis\nChief Revenue Officer\nWith its powerful no-code visual editor, VWO makes testing super easy for the non-techies. You can easily modify your website or add new elements without involving the development team. \nGoals\nGoodwillFinds offers a wide range of products for its consumers and the product detail page (PDP) is a crucial part of the conversion funnel. The company website is available for both mobile and desktop users, and the primary CTA on both these versions is the ‘Add-To-Bag’ button. GoodwillFinds wanted to improve the click activity on the CTA button, especially for the mobile website. \nObservations\nWhile analyzing the user behavior on the PDP, the team noticed that the number of CTA clicks on the desktop experience was much higher than the mobile experience. \nThe team also noted that the same content was being shown to users on both versions. However, since the mobile screen displays limited information at a time, users had to scroll down quite a bit to click on the ‘Add-To-Bag’ button. The page also had a few other sections that provided additional information to the user about shipping, returns, and authentication.\nHypothesis\nBased on this crucial insight, the GoodwillFinds team hypothesized that decluttering the PDP page for mobile, removing these additional sections, and placing the ‘Add-To-Bag’ button just after the product images would improve its visibility, thus increasing the number of clicks it receives.  \nTests run\nArmed with a strong hypothesis, GoodwillFinds ran an A/B test on the mobile product detail page (PDP) using VWO Testing. \nA new version of the PDP was created for the variation of this test with the following changes: \nRelevant information like product details and the ‘Add-To-Bag’ button were left unchanged\nContent-heavy sections like shipping and authentication were removed\nThe ‘More Like This’ section was placed just after the product details, giving it more visibility \nHere’s how the control and variation looked during the test.\nThis was a quick win for the team. After running the A/B test for merely 8 days, the variation emerged as the clear winner with a 5.16% increase in clicks on the ‘Add-To-Bag’ button.\nAnother crucial metric being tracked by GoodwillFinds was the ‘Place Order’ button that appeared after the product detail page (PDP). The team wanted to ensure that changes to the PDP had no negative impact on the performance of the ‘Place Order’ metric.\nAfter the conclusion of the test, a slight improvement was observed for this metric too. \n  Conclusion\nThe team at GoodwillFinds learned that decluttering the product detail page (PDP) is key to optimizing the website experience for mobile users. Also, they observed that implementing changes on the mobile version had virtually no impact on the ‘Add-To-Bag’ clicks or purchase rates of desktop users. \nVWO is a comprehensive platform that empowers you to optimize digital experiences and maximize conversions.

Started in a home office by Randy and Angie Stocklin in 2005, they’ve grown to become the world’s most people-focused eyewear company. \nPowered by a team that’s passionate about customers and a culture founded on strong Midwestern values, One Click has been voted as one of the Best Places to Work in Indiana for four consecutive years. \nGoals\nJon Corwin is the Director of Growth Marketing at One Click. One of his primary goals includes driving customer acquisition by identifying new marketing channels and effectively graduating them into One Click’s core marketing mix to increase revenue and drive top-line growth. \nWhen he joined One Click five years ago, his core focus was to improve the user experience of all three websites with a distinct focus on conversion rate optimization.\nObservations\n“Before I joined the company, our testing process was very ad-hoc. There was no regimented testing methodology or framework in place. We were using a plethora of tools and our testing data was completely scattered. My first task at hand was to fix this.” adds Jon Corwin, Director of Growth Marketing at One Click.\nHe started evaluating A/B testing and CRO platforms for One Click and came across VWO. Impressed with VWO’s capabilities, he got on a demo call with one of our representatives and decided to try the product. He and his team installed the VWO Smartcode and started collecting visitor engagement and interaction data. \nSetting up VWO helped Jon and his team get a better understanding of how their visitors were interacting with the website; pages they were spending time on, actions taken on the website, pages they were dropping off from, and many other data points.\n“Heatmaps, clickmaps, session recordings, and on-page surveys paint a full picture of how customers interact with different parts of our website. These insights have been instrumental in helping us understand our customers’ needs and eliminate the guesswork in our marketing efforts. \nVWO has helped us become more data-driven in our approach and we’ve successfully added features to facilitate customer needs and provide them a seamless website experience.” adds Jon Corwin.\nTests run\nOne Click’s Optimization Process\nJon has always believed that investments in conversion rate optimization, particularly for eCommerce companies is a top priority. Improving conversion rate can directly translate into profit to help drive the business forward. \nJon and his team collect tons of website data on a regular basis. Based on this data, they’ve built a repository of ideas that are documented in VWO Plan. Using the ICE framework (Impact-Confidence-Ease) they work in lockstep with their Engineering Team to rank different opportunities, prioritizing testing ideas that would prove to be the most impactful for the business.\nUsing VWO Testing, Jon and his team implement high-velocity experimentation frameworks,  launching 3-5 tests per week. They’ve seen a dramatic increase in their conversion rate and have been successful in scaling One Click’s three brands faster by accelerating their learnings. Run these tests on your website. Start your free trial today.\n“VWO helps us test at the speed that we desire. We like a lot of data and we like to run fast and VWO has not missed a beat for us in the last four years. We’ve never had any downtime or outages or any user issues. In the last 5 years, VWO has grown with us as a company and is deeply woven into our weekly sprint cycles, it’s something that we lean on very heavily on a day-to-day basis to help derive our learnings.” adds Jon Corwin, Director of Growth Marketing at One Click.\nOne Click’s Use Cases for VWO\nOver the years, Jon and his team have run hundreds of successful experiments for all their websites. We asked Jon to share some of his most successful and memorable experiments with us and here’s what he had to share. \nExperiment 1: Geo-based Messaging for Higher Checkouts\nHypothesis: Being a global eyewear brand, One Click drives traffic from different regions of the world. With the goal of improving conversions, they decided to personalize the checkout page for each user based on their country. \nImplementation: They ran the experiment using VWO custom segmentation which dynamically changed the content on the checkout page and localized it to make it more relevant to the user.\nSo, for instance, a customer from Canada would see Canadian shipping rates and other details such as estimated delivery time, Canadian currency, etc. This helped in making their shopping experience more engaging and highly personalized.\nReaders - Geo Based Messaging - Control\nReaders-Geo-based-Messaging-VARIANT\nResults: They saw a 30% increase in their conversion rate and achieved higher engagement with this experiment. \n“VWO’s capabilities make it extremely easy for us to deploy tests that render to a specific segment of traffic. With the tools that we were using in the past, we could only do this loosely, but it wasn’t as easy and could not be executed quickly.” adds Jon Corwin. \nExperiment 2: Discovering the impact of product videos on engagement and conversions\nHypothesis: During early optimization efforts of Readers.com, Jon and his team ran multiple tests on the product pages. They would experiment with page layout, try different product images, use various CTAs, etc. \nPurchasing reading glasses online comes with a lot of inhibitions. One of the initiatives they always wanted to test was product videos and make greater investments in video assets to strengthen decision making among customers. However, they were skeptical if the effort would be worthwhile. So, they decided to test it.\nImplementation: They added product videos highlighting the value of the product, its benefits and also got a few in-house experts to explain the features. The videos showcase different angles of the reading glasses and help users learn how they would look on different face shapes. \nReaders-Product-Videos-CONTROL\nReaders-Product-Videos-VARIANT\nResults: They noticed that a lot of visitors were engaging with the product videos and found them valuable while making a purchase. Conversion rates for pages with product videos were considerably higher than the ones that didn’t have videos. \nThis experiment helped them achieve a 10% increase in add to carts. \n“Because of this experiment and the information that VWO could provide us, we doubled down on our win and proceeded to fully roll out, adding videos to every single product catalog of readers.com. This has been a huge success for the team and one that we continue to get positive feedback from our users about how they enjoy the videos and how they help provide more information and why they continue to choose to purchase from us” says Jon Corwin, Director of Growth Marketing at One Click.\nThe way ahead\nMoving forward, Jon and his team want to maintain a rapid testing cadence. For a fast-paced industry that eCommerce is, Jon believes that one must be ahead of the curve or can get beat up by competitors pretty quickly. He says that having a tool like VWO at their disposal to accelerate the way they learn and grow really serves as a great competitive advantage.\n“We firmly believe that tools like VWO help us ensure we serve our customers the best we know how and if there’s a new channel or new experiment that we’d like to test, we know that we have the resources available to be able to test that out quickly. Teams who iterate quickly, win quickly” adds Jon Corwin.\nApart from exploring new channels, international expansion and improving the mobile experience will be high priorities for the One Click team. “We’re spending more and more time on improving our user experience to cater to mobile-first customers. We plan to use VWO to observe mobile visitors, identify conversion leaks, and enhance customer journeys” says Jon Corwin. \nStart your free trial today to experiment with your website.\nConclusion\nWhen asked to share his experience with VWO, here’s what Jon had to say, “VWO has not only helped to be our go-to CRO suite but from the Marketing Team’s perspective, VWO also helps us accelerate the ways in which we learn. VWO allows us to understand the ways our customers shop with us to better serve them through our marketing efforts and different campaigns that we deliver.\nLastly, VWO’s customer support has been absolutely outstanding. We’ve been fortunate that we’ve really not had many issues while using VWO, but in the few instances where we may have a specific technical question, the team has always been accessible and the response times have been terrific.” Jon Corwin, Director of Growth Marketing at One Click\nOne Click owns and operates three successful eyewear brands: Readers.com, Sunglass Warehouse, and felix + iris.",

Given the widespread belief that an easy eCommerce checkout experience results in better conversion rates and increased sales, its site also offered the Facebook login to speed up checkout.\nA developer pointed out that supporting a Facebook login added significant complexity to internal systems and processes, and wondered if it was really worth it. That question spurred the team to research Facebook login best practices as well as how they were used in other eCommerce stores.\nTests run: Split Testing to Establish if the Facebook Login Impacted Sales\nBliVakker.No used VWO to run a split URL test on 8,000 visitors. About half the visitors saw a login page with an email field and a Facebook login button; the other half saw only the email field.\nThis is what the original page with the Facebook login (control) looked like:\nBlivakker_fb_connect VWO success story\nThis is what the variation (checkout page without the Facebook login) looked like:\nBlivakker_nofb VWO success story\nConclusion: 3% Increase in Conversions\nThe hypothesis (and best practice) that checkout with the Facebook Connect would increase conversions was disproved. It was the variation without the Facebook login that delivered 3% more conversions. At BliVakker.No’s scale, this translated to incremental weekly sales of about US $10,000.\nAn important learning from this test is to use other ecommerce sites only as a guide while initially setting up your own checkout process. It is always best to test if those “best practices” apply to your business context. And run those tests before you start paid campaigns so that you don’t lose money.",

The UK market has a couple of dominant players, but many smaller companies sell similar products. Price is the primary basis on which the smaller players compete for business. Paperstone uses VWO to optimize its website.\nGoals\nA challenger seeking to target the large, established brands in the UK office supplies market, Paperstone wanted to use its website to make buyers aware that it offered products at prices lower than what the larger players offered. Paperstone believed that doing so would increase sales and hence market share.\nTests run\nGeorge and his team hypothesized that displaying their competitors’ higher prices on 5,000 product pages will increase clicks on ‘Add To Basket’ and their overall website conversion rate.\nThis is what control looked like:\nThe team decided to display competitor prices along with Paperstone’s prices on the relevant product pages of the web site. However, as the team considered this change, concerns arose about the possible impact on visitors/ buyers:\nWould displaying competitors’ prices drive potential customers to competitors, if the buyer was not previously aware that our competitors sold the product or if the price difference was only small?\nCompetitor prices were not available for all products, thus, would Paperstone be perceived as being more expensive on product pages that did not have competitor prices?\nWould adding competitor prices distract users?\nWould the test results be statistically significant?\nFinally, the team decided to set up the test so that visitors became a part of the test only if they visited one of the 5,000 product pages (out of 18,000) that had competitor price data.\nThis is what variation 1 looked like:\nThe test was run for over 12,000 unique visitors (50/50 split between control and variation). The test goals were to measure “add to basket” and conversions to sales. On both counts, the variation recorded a poorer performance than the control. However, the results were statistically inconclusive.\nA second round of tests was run using another variation in which the following changes were made:\nCompetitor prices were moved below “add to basket”. This was to test if moving the “add to basket” button down in Variation one had a negative impact.\nPut the Paperstone price next to the competitor prices and highlighted the savings. This was to make it easier for users to see the savings.\nTo eliminate the possibility of “banner blindness”, the design was made more “corporate” looking and the prices were shown under the header of “Price Comparison”.\nThis is what variation 2 looked like:\nUsing VWO, Variation 2 was tested for over 12,100 unique visitors (50/50 split between control and variation).\nConclusion\nThe second test was conclusive for an increase of 10.67% in conversion rate (at a 95% confidence) but inconclusive for clicks on “add to basket”.",

The UK market has a couple of dominant players, but many smaller companies also sell similar products. Price is the primary basis on which the smaller players compete for business.  \nPaperstone uses VWO to optimize its website www.paperstone.co.uk.\nGoals: Making Up Margins Lost through Increase in the Overall Revenue\nThrough a customer survey, Paperstone gathered that its prospects and customers expect bulk discounts. But given the highly competitive nature of the business, profit margins were already wafer-thin.\nOnly a higher number of customers—most of whom availed bulk discounts—may not protect margins. In other words, it was important for Paperstone that the sales value (revenue) increased to adequately cover the margins lost in giving bulk discounts. Therefore, offering bulk discounts would make sense only if there was a corresponding uplift in average order value.\nTests run: Offering Discounts for Bulk Purchases of Select Products\nPaperstone decided to test the hypothesis that bulk discount deals on select products would increase the profit margin from the website.\nThe Control page for the test was the original version that did not offer bulk discounts:\nA site-wide test was implemented, with the variation page offering discounts on bulk purchases of popular products.\nThis is how the offer was displayed on the Variation page:\nFor Paperstone director George Harris and his team, this was a crucial test. Results could go either way and would have a major bearing on changes that would needed to be made on the website.\nThe positioning of the bulk discount offer on the right sidebar belied the team’s expectation that the “bright yellow bulk-buy ribbon” would draw visitors’ attention. However, it seemed that the new design created “banner blindness” for visitors, who completely ignored the offer. So not surprisingly, the bulk discount offers didn’t make any difference to their conversions.\nAfter this initial failure, the team faced a lot of pressure to ditch the idea of bulk discounts and move on to other A/B tests. This was also a complicated test to run and track because not all visitors who came to the site might be interested in buying products on which bulk discounts were offered. So, the test needed to be run for a longer period, and with more visitors tested, to get a statistically significant result.\nDespite these challenges, the team decided to take another shot at the same hypothesis. They used VWO to track revenue.\nGiven below is the new variation they used for their second test:\nThis new variation was tested against the same control mentioned earlier in the post.\nHere is the comparison image that summarizes the 2 tests for you:\nEach version received more than 10,000 visitors.\nConclusion: 16.85% Increase in the Revenue\nPaperstone’s new Variation beat the Control, increasing the average order value by 18.94%. The increase in the average order value for bulk discount offers was 5%. The net increase in revenue was 16.85%.\nIt is worth noting here that although bulk discounts were offered only on select products, there was a sizeable increase in the average order value.\nAn important takeaway from this experience was that a failed test does not necessarily mean the entire hypothesis needs to be discarded. Identifying possible loopholes and retesting after fixing such loopholes may still prove the hypothesis.",

Perfect Plants, with an array of plants, shrubs, and trees, began its online journey in 2013 to reach more consumers.\nPerfect Plants has a culture of achieving excellence at each stage of order delivery. They are known for providing healthy, beautiful, and fast-growing trees. The company uses VWO to experiment and perfect the consumer experience in its digital store.\nVWO is by far the easiest testing tool. Our marketing team doesn’t have to rely on any development resources to create & implement tests. The variables offered for A/B and Multi-variate testing fit just about any need. They also have insightful suggestions and tons of real-time examples.\nAlex Kantor\nPresident\nWe recently discussed with the Perfect Plants team their experience with VWO and the results they achieved.\nGoals\nThe marketing team at Perfect Plants noticed that they had a lower conversion rate from product to cart page on the mobile version of their website. They wanted to experiment with the product page and improve the conversion rate.\nObservations\nThe team at Perfect Plants observed an interesting pattern on the mobile version of the website. They noticed that visitors were bouncing off the product page if they were unable to scroll through the image carousel which is right under the product title.\nTests run\nThe hypothesis was that a change in the image positioning would positively affect the add-to-cart button click rate. The team chose an A/B test and set a click-on elements goal for the add-to-cart button using the VWO. \nThe control version which was the original website product page had a title followed by an image carousel with the add-to-cart button at the bottom. In Variation 1, the team moved the image carousel below the button, and in Variation 2 the image was completely removed.\nHere is how the control and variations looked:\nThe A/B test gave some interesting insights. Variation 1, with the image at the bottom of the add-to-cart button, had an expected conversion rate of 4.85%, which was 8.48% more than the control version conversion rate. \nHowever, Variation 2, which had no image, outperformed control and Variation 1. The conversion rate for it was 5.34%, a 19.26% improvement from the baseline of the control conversion rate. \n  Here is the detailed report from the VWO dashboard:\nConclusion\nThe ease of experimentation setup and VWO’s drag-and-drop Visual Editor helped the team to make improvements on their mobile website leading to higher conversions.

        "raw_contents": "About Provident Hotels & Resorts\nProvident Hotels & Resorts, which began as a residential condominium management organization, quickly evolved into a pioneer of the Condominium Hotel Industry. By 1980, they had established one of the first “condo-hotel” properties on the Gulf Coast of Florida. Reservations in Provident’s hotels, resorts and condos can be made via providentresorts.com.\nProvident hired Sabre Hospitality Solutions Digital Marketing to optimize its website and drive more clicks on the CTA buttons, which used VWO’s platform and tools for its optimization work.\nGoals\nWith an aim to increase the number of clicks on Provident’s CTA buttons, Sabre decided to optimize the combination of form title and CTA button text by performing a multivariate test.\nTests run\nThis is the page where the test was conducted:\nWhen a user clicked on the dates, the CTA that appeared looked like this:\nThe original title on the form, “Make a Reservation” was tested against two variations – “Book Your Stay” and “Reserve a Room”. The original text on the CTA button was “Check Availability”. “Book Now”, “Find Rooms” and “Search” were created as variations.\nSabre wanted to see which combination of form title and button text would drive most visitors to check for rates and availability of rooms. The test goal being tracked was the number of clicks on the CTA button. As the reservation console was visible on all their pages, the test was run sitewide by using *websitename.com* pattern to match all URLs.\nSince there were 3 variations of the first element (form title) and 4 variations of the second element (CTA button text), VWO automatically generated the following 12 combinations (3×4) to be pitted against each other:\nThe test was run on a total of 27,500 visitors over a month. The traffic was equally split among the 12 combinations.\nConclusion\nCombination 12, with Form title “Reserve a Room” and CTA text “Search” won, recording a 9.1% improvement in CTR.\nExplaining the test results, Kelsey Slater, Web Strategy Manager at Sabre Hospitality Solutions, said:\n“I think the 12th combination won because the “Reserve a Room” headline describes exactly what the user is trying to do when they click on the call-to-action button. They are going to “Search” for rooms that are available during that time frame, looking to reserve a room doing the desired timeframe they select. When someone thinks about making a reservation, they may consider that with a reservation at a restaurant. But I think Reserve a Room is specific to hotels to tell the user that they are only looking to reserve a room when they click-through this reservation console to initiate this process. Additionally, search is the immediate action that happens when they click-through to the console.”",

        "raw_contents": "About Yo! Free Samples\nEverything free comes with a hidden price tag. Everything free on the internet usually comes with a hidden survey. What sets Yo! Free Samples apart from run-of-the-mill websites offering Free Samples and Coupons are precisely their take on this. Founded in 2007, this website has been keeping its proposition clear and upfront for the last ten years – Free Samples without Surveys.\nGoals\nThe primary objective of Yo! Free Samples was to deliver time-sensitive deals to its customers before they expired.\nObservations\nJohn ‘Samples’ Clark is the key writer at Yo! Free Samples. He carefully curates daily online deals and posts them along with the requirements of each of its customers. One of the unique challenges in his domain is that the content should remain perpetually fresh. You wouldn’t want customers clicking on an expired offer and leaving empty-handed.\nWhen John came across web push notifications from VWO Engage, he sensed a solution to this problem and decided to give it a spin.\nTests run\nSetting up VWO Engage was easy. All John had to do was install the VWO Smartcode to his website and, voila! Since then, he has received quarter of a million sessions from push notifications alone and 99% of them have been from returning visitors.\nEarlier, John used to reach out to his customers through email newsletters. After adopting push notifications, he has unlocked a very effective symbiosis between the two channels. He reaches out to his customers with an offer, first thing in the morning, through a push notification. He ends the day with an email newsletter, sharing the best offers.\nSometimes, his newsletter subscribers would write to him about offers that they missed – deals that would have expired by the time they opened the emails and landed on the website. In such cases, he has the solution ready now – push notifications. He introduces the upset customers to this channel and once they subscribed to it, they received real-time offers whenever they logged onto the platform.\nThe working relationship shows that a new channel need not work as an alternative to your tried and tested ones. It can also work in tandem to send the right message, at the right time.\nConclusion\nYo! Free Samples gets an average click rate of 17.96% from their push notifications. This is huge when you think about the average click rates for commercial emails which is around 2-4%. Their best click rate for notifications is a whopping 39%. Since notifications are linked to specific landing pages, the users are led exactly to where the offer is available on the website. This has ensured an average session time of 2 minutes and 52 seconds among users landing through notifications.\nPush Notification Tips by John Clark\nJohn states that the images used in the notification play an important role in persuading the receivers to click on them. What worked best for his platform were the actual images of samples on offer. Keeping the copy succinct and on point, similar to paid search ads, also helped them boost their click rates.\n“VWO Engage is helping me start the day with my readers on the right foot by providing them content at the right time. It keeps the content fresh when other channels can get stale fast – a unique problem faced by the deals space,” said John ‘Samples’ Clark, Website Owner of Yo! Free Samples, when asked about his experience using VWO Engage.",

It is known for publishing games for several acclaimed video game franchises, including Assassin’s Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, For Honor, and more.\nThe company has a presence in 6 continents and employs over 13,000 people. The teams in Ubisoft’s worldwide network of studios and business offices deliver original and memorable gaming experiences across all popular platforms.\nGoals\nFor Ubisoft, the improvement in lead generation and conversions that happen on the Buy Now page of their website was a key performance indicator when it came to user experience.\nThe process began by studying the existing page to create a hypothesis that could be tested for improvement on the VWO platform. The stated objective was to improve lead generation for the game, For Honor, on the Buy Now page. The services team at VWO worked in tandem with Jenny’s team to achieve the desired objective.\nTests run\nThe Ubisoft team collected visitor data using heatmaps, scrollmaps, clickmaps, and on-page surveys and analyzed the data to build a strong hypothesis for testing. The hypothesis was to reduce the up and down scroll and simplify the entire buying process.\nAfter collating the data, VWO Services team suggested a complete design overhaul for For Honor’s Buy Now page and constructed an A/B test based on the new design using VWO. With VWO heatmaps, you can visualize your customer’s journey in real-time. Start a free trial to see how.\nA/B testing of a new design for the Buy Now page based on the test hypothesis would demonstrate that the variation delivered more in terms of lead generations and conversion.\nThe Buy Now page before the testing phase:\nThe user on the Buy Now page would first have to select the preferred version of the game from the five versions displayed on the screen.\nThe user was then expected to scroll down and select the platform on which they would play.\nThe final step was the Place Your Order button that took them to the checkout page on the Ubisoft store.\nThe New Test Variation\nThe hypothesis was to reduce the up and down scroll and simplify the entire buying process.\nTo support that goal, the design and the layout of the page were changed.\nIn the redesigned test layout, the section to choose edition, console, as well as the Order Now step were moved to the top of the left column, with an edition comparison.\nThe new design eliminated scroll and improved the interaction time/rate on the Buy now page.\nThe test was run during the holiday season (October–December 2017), due to the higher influx of traffic. During this phase, the traffic was 60% higher than usual.\nComparison of the test data between the old and the new layouts on the VWO platform clearly demonstrated that the redesigned version increased the lead generation rate by 12% (from 38% to 50% conversions).\nConclusion\nThe results motivated the Ubisoft team to rethink and undertake testing of checkout pages on a series of games, with the intent of arriving at a standardized version.\nThe Ubisoft team also decided to use surveys, session replays, and heatmap data to optimize its conversion funnels further and bolster on-site engagement.\nFor Ubisoft, these are repeatable results which pave the way to increased revenues.\nOptimize your website to create holistic customer experiences with VWO testing. Take a free trial today!\nWe ran a series of A/B tests based on the data we gathered by using Heatmaps, Scrollmaps and Surveys available on the VWO Platform. It helped us to identify key elements on our websites that needed a deeper look.\nJenny Hughes\nDigital Marketing",

They were on a look-out for:\nA platform that would let them run advanced tests without the need to code extensively\nA team that would actively assist in ideation and as well as implementation \nA single platform to track all the experiment metrics\nVWO ticked all of these boxes, and Dorado Fashion has been using VWO Services since 2019 for all their experience and conversion optimization needs. Request a demo if you would like to discuss your needs with VWO’s optimization experts.\nGoals\nAt an organizational level, Dorado Fashion wanted to increase sales and identify experience breakages in their existing website through continuous and robust testing. The aim was also to improve conversions for their store from different social channels. \nEach of the tests discussed here had a different end goal:\nTest  1: Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)\nTest  2: Increasing overall business conversions\nTests run\nDorado Fashion, in collaboration with VWO Services, ran a series of tests  to optimize their website and improve conversions. Discussed below are various campaigns that helped Dorado Fashion increase their eCommerce conversion rate:\n  Test  1: Adding bundle offer in the mini cart, on all devices\nObjective: Increasing Average Order Value (AOV)\nObservation: High drop-off on the checkout page was leading to a high cart abandonment rate. The probable causes were :\nThe absence of offers to potential customers when 1 product is added to the cart\nNo saving amount being shown to potential customers to make them complete a purchase\nCustomer confusion between the total amount they are saving and any additional discounts\nHypothesis: The team at Dorado Fashion hypothesized that providing discount offers upfront on the checkout page would result in reduced drop-offs. With the aim of increasing AOV by incentivizing additional product purchases, a notice “You are 1 product away to get Extra 30% Off” was added in the variation.\nControl\nVariation\nResults: The test ran for 26 days and the variation won with a 14.14% increase in clicks to the Thank You page, and the variation was made live for the entire audience. \n  Test  2 – Redesigning the search icon for Mobile Device\nObjective: Increasing overall business conversions\nObservation: The Dorado Fashion team ran heatmaps on the homepage and noticed that 30% of the visitors clicked on the search icon but only 1% searched for the products. This was primarily because the search results were inaccurate, and additionally, heatmaps using VWO Insights indicated that visitors were getting distracted by the background. \nHypothesis: By directing visitors’ focus only on the search bar, and by helping them with popular searches (which can be controlled) visitors would land on desired landing pages, thereby, increasing overall business conversions.\nControl\nVariation\nResults: The test ran through VWO Testing for 33 days and the variation won with a 26.55% increase in conversion rate compared to control.\nConclusion\nThe journey with VWO unraveled the true potential of Conversion Rate Optimization for Dorado Fashion. CRO now sits at the center of all of Dorado Fashion’s optimization efforts. They continue to use VWO Services to test more on their checkout pages with the goal of increasing their sales and improving their conversion rate even further. If you would like to optimize your checkout and landing pages through quick and easy A/B tests, take a free trial with VWO. \n\n\nAfter the 80% increase in overall eCommerce conversion rate resulting from the above-enumerated campaigns, that too in just 3 months, the team at Dorado Fashion intends to continue the winning experiment streak with many future steps planned:\nWith 97% of their traffic coming from mobile devices, Dorado Fashion plans to focus more on delivering a stellar app-like mobile experience to the users\nDeveloping a funnel-like user experience on mobile devices, including a one-step checkout\nMaking the personalization process easier for users\nTesting the order of sections on the product page layout to find that one order, that resonates with the users most",

        "raw_contents": "About Portland Trail Blazers\nThe Portland Trail Blazers are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team. To optimize their conversion funnel and increase ticket sales from their online platform, they hired Sq1, a Portland-based digital marketing agency. Sq1 is a certified VWO partner.\nGoals\nAfter analyzing the Trail Blazers’ website and the navigation menu, the Sq1 team concluded that there were multiple usability issues that impeded online ticket sales. The navigation was the team’s primary focus, as it was present on almost all of the website pages and hence had a wide reach.\nThis was the original menu design on the page.\nTests run\nFrom a usability point of view, the team identified 4 main reasons why they felt that the existing navigation menu design was not effective:\nThe horizontal menu was strenuous especially for mobile users, as the entire menu could not be seen at once. Visitors had to scroll to get a complete view of the menu items.\nThe semi-transparent background made it harder for visitors to read category items listed on the menu.\nFurther, the horizontal layout required visitors to carefully scan the entire menu, both vertically and horizontally, to find what they were looking for. This was simply too much work.\nThe menu items were split into 4 columns, and the 4 X 3 grid structure gave visitors the impression that there was some sort of logical organization in the menu when there was none. The menu would, therefore, seem confusing to visitors, especially to the new ones.\nGiven the high volume of traffic the Trail Blazers website enjoyed, the conversion team knew that even a relatively small lift would have a huge impact on revenue. Therefore, the conversion optimization team took the calculated risk of performing the A/B test right in the middle of the basketball season, when ticket buying was at its highest. They were willing to take the risk, because they believed that they had a robust hypothesis that would be proved by the A/B test.\nThey hypothesized that redesigning the navigation menu to address the above issues will reduce visitor confusion and, therefore, send more traffic to the Individual Tickets page and increase the average revenue per visitor.\nThe team redesigned the navigation menu and then tested it site-wide on the VWO platform. The redesigned vertical menu is shown below:\nThe new menu was easier to read and parse, and helped quickly bring user attention to the Individual Tickets option. As in the original navigation, the Individual Tickets option remained highlighted in red.\nConclusion\nThe redesigned vertical navigation menu emerged a clear winner over the horizontal design. It increased revenue (and not just click-throughs) by 62.9% vis-a-vis the original.\nWe feel that the new vertical menu layout performed better because it honed visitors’ focus more toward the Individual Tickets option. We knew that most site visitors were interested in single game tickets, and any change to make that process as easy as possible would improve overall performance.\nkaena Miller\nAVP\n(On behalf of Portland Trail Blazers)\nThe horizontal menu scattered visitors’ attention, taking their focus more easily away from the highlighted Individual Tickets option. In contrast, the vertical menu seemed more structured and kept the focus on the primary highlighted option. Of course, the solid white background of the new menu helped the option highlighted in red stand out more.\nAlmost 15% of the traffic to the Portland Trail Blazers website originated from tablet devices. The new menu clearly helped this segment.\nBottom line: Visitors were more easily able to find what they were looking for, which most likely increased conversions.",

As they provide a suite of tools to businesses for creating and managing their online presence, getting the positioning right is critical.\nThey recently used VWO, an a/b testing tool, to A/B test which product positioning works the best.\nGoals\nWhile researching for your options for tools or services, which of the following pitches is going to appeal you most?\nBusinesses grow faster online!\nOnline advertising that works!\nGet found faster!\nCreate a webpage for your business.\nTo manage their online presence, it was critical for CityCliq to get their positioning right.\nTests run\nThe conversion goal for this test was click-throughs to their pricing plan. Implementation-wise, this test was simple to set up (took them just 15 minutes to do so); the major effort was invested in coming up with good candidates for positioning.\nThey ran the test for 2 weeks on their home page and were quite happy with the results.\nConclusion\nHere’s how different positioning statements fared against each other:\nPitch Conversion Rate % Improvement over Original Statistically Significant?\nBusinesses grow faster online! (original) 25.3% – –\nCreate a webpage for your business 47.8% 90% Yes\nGet found faster! 31.8% 26% No\nOnline advertising that works! 20.2% -20% No\nAbout the results, here is what CityCliq had to say:\nCreate a webpage for your business was our last test tagline and eventually showed a 98% chance of beating the original. In retrospect, its success makes sense, as it’s perhaps the purest, most direct representation of our product. It didn’t surprise me, as user behavior seems to vary wildly on the web. Plus, there hasn’t been much research done on the behavior of our target audience, so these results were more informative than surprising.\nWhat they meant is that this A/B test yielded more than just an increase in the conversion rate. The test informed them about the psychology of their target customer. This is a perfect example of how A/B split testing can be used to peek into the minds of customers, to see misalignment of what they want and what they think you offer.\nCreate a webpage for your business as the winning variation tells that CityCliq’s prospective customers are already aware of benefits of being online and in fact are looking for a tool to make that process simpler. All other variations tried to pitch the advantages of being online, which clearly isn’t that appealing to the customers.\nAnother point to note is that all but the winning variation had an exclamation mark. It would be interesting if they follow up the test with 2 versions of the winning variation – one with an exclamation mark and the other without it.\nPer the above A/B test, CityCliq implemented the winning variation permanently on the home page (as you can see on the screenshot) and subsequently saw a rise in user actions. Inspired by their first successful test, they hope to set up a lot of A/B split tests in near future.",

Its original pricing page had basic information like cost per month, space, bandwidth, and domains, but did not mention discounts.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nTeam Meebox wanted to test the hypothesis that offering discounts would increase the number of people who sign up. The team created a variation page that offered discounts to customers who locked in for a 2-year period.\nThis was the variation:\nThe variation was A/B tested against the original by using VWO. Discounts ranged from 20% to 40% for the highest plan.\nConclusion: 121% Increase in the Revenue\nThe variation with price discounts increased revenue as well as the average order value (AOV) and the number of people who signed up. Here were the test results:\n121.56% increase in revenue (98% chance to beat original)\n46.24% increase in the average order value\n51.85% increase in conversions (customers/visitors-to-page)\nThe key takeaway is to ensure that discounts to customers also enable your business to derive value. In this case, Meebox tied users to their service for 2 years by offering the discounts. It’s common knowledge that retaining existing customers is far easier than acquiring new ones. Such a lock-in also allows Meebox at least 24 months in which to cross-sell, up-sell, and promote additional services.",

        "raw_contents": "About Buildium\nBuildium is a property management software that is used to manage more than 600,000 residential units in 31 countries worldwide.\nBuildium’s competitors have pigeonholed us by claiming we are only appropriate for small property managers (50 units or less)*. To combat this perception, we decided to change a few elements on our website through A/B testing different variations of our messaging.\nGoals\nWe ran 2 separate A/B tests to see how we could improve the messaging on both the home page and pricing page. The aim of these tests was to market the product to a wider range of property managers.\nThe aim of these tests was to increase conversions by more effectively advertising the number of units that Buildium supports.\nTests run\nThe test on the home page was to see whether we could increase conversions by displaying testimonials from small, medium, and large property managers, communicating that our software works great, no matter how many units you manage.\nThe control on our website had a heading: “Proof, meet pudding. We can help you too”, with the subhead that read: “We have over 8000 happy customers across the world.” This was followed by testimonials from our customers with no mention of the customer’s unit size. This failed to bring out the fact that we’re serving customers ranging from small, medium to large property managers.\nThis is what the control looked like:\nIn an attempt to boost free trial sign-ups, we decided to test a new presentation of our testimonials that more clearly articulated the scalability of our product. Each testimonial displayed the company’s unit count for context, and the testimonial copy itself spoke to the specific benefits that Buildium provides to a company of that size. We also introduced a new headline (Whatever your size, Buildium is the perfect fit) to echo this messaging.\nAlthough we understand that the most statistically significant tests only change 1 element on the page; however, for the sake of this test, we chose to introduce these 3 changes that all work together to form the new experience. We tested 3 variations of this new experience against the control, each with a different subhead.\nHere’s how the winning variation read:\nConclusion\nFor the home page, the winning variation was the one that specifically mentioned our ability to handle small, medium, and large companies. The new headline, testimonial copy, and the addition of the unit count had a positive effect on conversions, as all of the new variations converted at a higher rate than the control.\nI believe that subhead of the variation above was the most successful because it set the expectation that the three testimonials below would be from companies of these three sizes. And since we followed this by mentioning the units of the property owners, we were successful in getting across the message that Buildium serves more than just small businesses.\nOur new marketing site has a trial form embedded directly at the bottom of the homepage, which means that we needed to track for two separate conversion goals: submitting the form, or clicking the CTA to go to free-trial.\nBelow you will find the results for each goal, with the sum of the two used to calculate the total success of the variation.\nBased on the VWO results, all of the variations had conversion rates higher than the control. This leads me to believe that regardless of the subhead, the addition of the new headline, testimonials, and unit count all created an experience that more effectively communicated the scalability of our product, attracting a wider range of customers.\nNote: In our industry, small property management companies generally manage up to 100 units, medium ones manage 100 to 600 units, and large ones manage more than 600 units. Our largest customer uses our software to manage over 7,000 units. There are also “extra-large” companies who might manage tens of thousands of units, but we do not market to these companies as they would be better suited with an enterprise solution.",

Veeam is a multinational company with global headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, with more than 800 employees and 39,000 customers worldwide.\nThey used VWO to run optimization tests on their website.\nGoals\nIn December 2011, Veeam used KissInsights (now Qualaroo) to run a survey targeted at all visitors to their product pages. The question asked was “What other information would you like to see on this page?” and a lot of answers said “Pricing.” The company does not publish pricing information on their pages, because they sell through partners and discounts given out by different partners may vary. However, they did have a Request a quote link that led to a Sales Inquiry form.\nThe goal of the test was to increase the click-through rate to the sales inquiry page.\nTests run\nHypothesis\nChanging the link text from Request a quote to Request pricing will increase the click-through rate.\n\nTest\nBased on the survey results, they used VWO to A/B test between Request a quote and Request pricing.\nHere’s the original image, or the Control version:\nHere’s the changed image, or the Variation version:\nConclusion\nA straight 161.66% increase in the click-through rate from 0.54% to 1.40% with 100% statistical confidence (VWO reports 99.9x% as 100%). That’s a huge increase, and it must have taken only about 2 minutes to set up the test.\nSome of you might feel that this result would be more concrete if the number of leads generated would drastically increase. Well, you’re right. However, optimizing a website involves tweaking multiple steps of the sales funnel. The next step after optimizing the click-through rate to a sales inquiry page would be to try and increase the form submit rate.\nInsights\nVeeam have done a lot right here. The first was starting off by gathering data and feedback. The best conversion (and scientific) experiments start with observation and asking for feedback. Then, they listened to their customers. As you probably know, it’s difficult to go wrong if you listen closely to your customers and change accordingly.\nThe final bit of actionable insight is to be direct and clear in your communication. This is especially true of the web, where consumers are attuned to filtering out anything except the core information they’re looking for. If they don’t find it quickly, they just bounce.\nWhat do you think of the test? What would you do in the next steps? Please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments.",

Individuals can sign up for a free account on their website and begin using the planner right away to create and manage online planning schedules.\nThe company used VWO tools to increase conversions from its website home page.\nGoals: Increase the Number of Visitors Signing Up for the Account\nTom, the company’s founder, was keen to increase the number of conversions from the home page. The website’s home page originally had 2 CTA buttons above the fold – 1 each to sign up for an account and to watch a demo of the software.\nThis is how the original home page of the website looked:\nTests run: A/B Test to Increase Conversions through Suggested Changes on the Home Page\nTo improve conversions from the home page, it was decided to add a sign-up form on the home page, above the fold. The form had just 4 fields, which made it easy to fill. A directional cue was added to direct visitors’ attention to the form and direct visitors to the CTA.\nA variation was created using VWO, and it was tested against the original home page.\nHere’s how the new home page looked:\nClose to 3,000 visitors became a part of this A/B test, and the result was in favor of the variation.\nHere’s a quick comparison image showing the original home page and the variation:\nConclusion: 44% Increase in Home Page Sign-Ups\nThe hypothesis that a simple CTA would attract attention was proved right. The new home page with the sign-up form recorded 44% more conversions.\nWe believe 3 key factors contributed to the improvement in conversions with the variation:\n1) The sign-up form was placed above the fold\nFor visitors to sign up, the original home page had one CTA button above the fold. Adding a form to the page increased the likelihood of visitors signing up, as they could see the form right on the home page, above the fold. Also, they didn’t have to click through a CTA button or reach a different page to create an account. Signing up became easier.\n2) Short form with just 4 fields\nAs the sign-up form had only 4 fields, it reduced the friction to signing up for an account. The form asked only for the visitor’s email address; they did not have to share any other personal details to create the account. This helped build trust.\n3) Adding a directional cue\nIt has been proven in multiple eye-tracking studies that directional cues get immediate attention, because visitors can’t help but notice in the direction they point. The arrow pointing toward the sign-up form not only increased the form’s visibility, but also gave users a clear path of action that moved them to the next stage of the funnel.",

        "raw_contents": "About Myenglishteacher\nAnastasia Koltai had a simple yet laudable vision- to enable anyone with an internet connection to learn English, for free. She decided to create ‘The World’s Friendliest Online English Language School’ and in 2010, MyEnglishTeacher.eu was launched.\nThe website offers one-to-one English lessons over Skype with instructors who are native speakers of the language. Apart from live chat rooms, the online school also provides a wealth of resources like quizzes and videos to their students. Anastasia excitedly tells us that through MyEnglishTeacher, she wants to help people from all over the world become proficient speakers of English.\nGoals\nMyEnglishTeacher relied heavily on email marketing to engage their users. After testing different send times, templates, email subject-lines, and content, they were able to increase their opt-in rate to 3.5% and click-through rate to 10%.\nAnastasia was happy with these numbers they were getting from email marketing. When she first saw push notifications powered by VWO Engage on another website, she decided to give it a try.\nTests run\nIn a single day, they got 160+ subscribers through push notifications alone.\nPushCrew opt-in on MyEnglishTeacher.eu\nWith VWO Engage, Anastasia is able to send a new notification to their audience, any time, in less than a minute.\n“It takes me 30 seconds to create a new notification and it’s amazing to see hundreds of people coming to your website right after the notification is sent. I don’t have to pay an assistant to create it and it is much more effective than email marketing.”\nTo find out the best time to send a notification, Anastasia played with the scheduling feature of VWO Engage. She has now found a time at which people are most receptive to her messages. She uses web push notifications to promote everything from new videos to short quizzes on their website.\nPushCrew welcome push notification from MyEnglishTeacher.eu\nAnastasia’s team has also made use of the welcome notification feature of VWO Engage. As soon as you subscribe to notifications from MyEnglishTeacher, you get a welcome notification saying that they are glad to see you. And they also offer a quick complimentary lesson on other ways to say “Nice to meet you”.\nConclusion\nAs they were depending a lot on email marketing in the past, Anastasia was happy to use a technology that could let her communicate with their audience in a quick and crisp manner with 2X better results.\n“After one and a half month of using VWO Engage, we have over 6000 subscribers. Impressive. It is a subscription rate we have with our email opt-in as well. However, we had to test titles, colors, and content for months to improve our email subscription rate to 3.5%. With push notifications, we get the same results without testing anything.\nOur email open rate is quite high – normally over 35%, however the CTR is low (10%) compared to the CTR of push notifications, which is at 20%.”\nAnastasia now aims to improve the CTR of the push notifications further by testing what content works best. She also hopes that, in the near future, she would be able to do more sophisticated targeting and even add emojis in notifications.\nAccording to Anastasia:\n“30 seconds is all it takes to create a notification and it is much more effective than email marketing!“",

The CTA enables users to reserve a product for in-store pickup.\nHypothesis\nThe observations led schuh’s CRO team to come up with hypotheses addressing both issues:\nKlarna payment option: Indicating Klarna’s availability during delivery selection would likely improve checkout completion rates.\nCTA placement: Moving the “Collect or Reserve” CTA higher up on the page would increase user interaction with this option.\nTests run\nThe CRO team at schuh decided to run A/B tests to validate the hypotheses using VWO.\nKlarna payment option\nThis A/B test included the control and 2 variations. In the control, they did not explain to the user which payment options were available per delivery method. \nVariation B displayed a simple message at the point of delivery selection informing the user if the Klarna payment method was eligible or not, and Variation C had the same functionality with a slight wording tweak.\nHere’s a visual of how the control and Variation B appeared:\nThe results were conclusive: Variation B emerged as the winner, improving the checkout completion rate by 1.36% over the baseline.\nCTA placement\nOn the original page, the “Collect or Reserve” CTA was not visible in the first fold, while the Variation B brought it to the top fold. Here’s a look at both versions:\nControl (left) & Variation B (right)\nThe results were clear: Variation B was the winner, improving the CTA conversion rate by 19.7% over the control. Impressively, this adjustment did not impact the conversions of the primary “Add-to-Bag” CTA.\nConclusion\nWith VWO, schuh’s CRO team improved checkout completion rates and the conversion of the “Collect & Reserve” CTA.\nVWO proved to be an invaluable partner in schuh’s success.

        "raw_contents": "About IDEAL OF SWEDEN\nFounded in 2013, IDEAL OF SWEDEN is a Swedish lifestyle brand for fashion and tech accessories. All products are created in the in-house design studio, inspired by the latest trends and developments in fashion, interior, and tech, to build innovative products with excellent design and quality at their core. Today, with over 180 employees, IDEAL OF SWEDEN functions on the principle that nothing is ever finished – everything can always be improved.\nThis mindset works in their favor not only for building products but also for their CRO activities – which they have been carrying out successfully using the VWO platform as well as VWO Services (the consultancy arm of VWO). \nWe spoke to Christoffer Kjellberg, CRO Manager at IDEAL OF SWEDEN to understand more about his approach to CRO, recent experiments, and plans for the future. \nWhy was VWO chosen over AB Tasty?\nAt the time when Christoffer joined the company, they used Google Optimize for their experimentation needs. However, they wanted to scale up and not be held back by any limitations that come with free tools like Google Optimize.\nWe found that as compared to Optimizely, VWO and A/B Tasty were more in line with our company’s CRO budget. We wanted a services team to assist us in the development of experiments, but also a robust platform that would allow us to do everything on our own – these were our two primary requirements.  While A/B Tasty also offered a services team, the standard of the VWO platform in terms of ease of experimentation exceeded that of the former. After a thorough evaluation of A/B Tasty and VWO, we felt that VWO better addressed the experimentation needs of IDEAL OF SWEDEN.\nChristoffer Kjellberg\nCRO Manager\nHaving used VWO now, Christoffer identifies the widget library and the reporting as the most helpful features. The fact that elements can be saved and reused from the library makes the testing process efficient. \nIDEAL OF SWEDEN operates in 27 markets. So when they build a test, they can roll that out to 27 markets, and then can look at the test data as a whole, while also drilling down on how each domain performed along with other useful segmentation possibilities. Christoffer believes that this can be easily managed with VWO, something that used to take a lot of time previously. “A lot of time is saved with this kind of accurate and quick reporting that VWO offers.”, he says.\nVWO’s powerful Visual Editor makes it easy to edit and add webpage elements – no coding required. Try it out with a 30-day free trial.\nGoals\nThe idea was to leverage Black Month to increase overall purchases from the eCommerce store. To achieve this, they created a VIP experience prior to black week for special customers entering the website with specific URL queries. A hidden campaign was triggered for these customers where the motivation was for the users to grab items before the sale opened up for everyone during Black Week. Once the Black Week sale started, the goal was to convince visitors to buy before the sale ended with discounts being the main motivation.\nTests run\nCountdown banner\nThe team hypothesized that showing the countdown banner, sticky across the website, will create an urgency in the visitors’ minds to purchase items before the sale ends, hence leading to more conversions in the sale period. This also helped in informing more visitors about the sale. \nThe sticky countdown banner was placed on the header for the last 3 days of each phase of the black month campaigns, which were Singles Day, Hidden VIP Black Week Access, Black Week, Cyber Monday. \nThis is what the control and variation looked like:\nThe primary metric being tracked in this test was ‘Clicks on Add-to-cart’ and the variation was declared a winner with 5.6% uplifts on this primary metric. \nOnce the test showed positive results, it was very easy for the team to deploy the banner functionality on their website with VWO Web Rollouts.\n“For a company like ours, it is very important to analyze the potential revenue increase in order to have a data-driven budget foundation to build similar functionality on our CMS – because now we have proof that it works. The more we test, the more qualitative winners we will receive, the more our budget will increase for us to improve our website experience.”, says Christoffer.\nTest learnings and roadmap\nThe test was run on all pages except the checkout page and some pages performed better than others. Based on the outcome of this test, the team learned that in the future they could also check for pages that didn’t perform as well and brainstorm what could be changed in the messaging there to try and personalize the experience. They could also think about personalizing the experience for visitors coming from Facebook and Instagram – as the eCommerce store gets a lot of traffic from these social media sites. \nSo this experiment is a starting point for the team at IDEAL OF SWEDEN and their aim is to build on this functionality and reuse it to create the necessary hype around future events.\nSocial media and shipping banner\nThe team hypothesized that showing the brand’s IG followers and messaging around climate compensated shipping will act as social proof and create trust in the visitors’ minds, hence pushing them forward in the conversion funnel. This test was carried out to eliminate any hesitation on the part of visitors to complete their purchases. The primary goal tracked in this test was also the number of clicks on the ‘Add-to-cart’ button. \nThis is what the control and variations looked like:\nVWO’s reporting allows the slice and dice of results. While variation 2 was the clear winner, data revealed that for the climate compensated region, the uplift achieved was higher. There was an improvement of 1.44% in conversions for all visitors that participated in the test and a 1.6% improvement in conversions for specifically the climate compensated countries (the shipping message was targeted at visitors from these countries as this is one of the main motivations of the target persona group). On the product detail pages, the conversion for this group was even higher at 1.97%.\nConclusion\nWorking in tandem with VWO services, the team at IDEAL OF SWEDEN is building a steady testing velocity where they discuss and put new ideas into the roadmap on a biweekly basis.\nWe’re satisfied and glad we picked VWO. We’re getting the ROI from our experiments and have a great working relationship with the VWO Services team who push us to test more and more in the best possible way.\nChristoffer Kjellberg\nCRO Manager\nVWO is designed to make experimentation easy for you so that you can test quickly and drive results faster.

        "raw_contents": "About Majestic Wine\nMajestic Wine is a well-known retailer of wines in the UK. The company launched its online store to grow its business by attracting clients from outside the UK as well.\nThe online marketing team at Majestic Wine uses VWO to test various optimization hypotheses aimed at improving conversions from its website.\nGoals: Boost Conversion by Increasing Enquiry Form Submissions\nMajestic Wine saw a lucrative opportunity in the weddings services space and wanted to boost conversions by increasing enquiry form submissions.\nTests run: Redesign Webpage and Test It for Conversions\nWeddings represented a lucrative business opportunity for the company because catering to such occasions typically meant larger order sizes that would boost the average order value and margins.\nThe Majestic Wine team knew that it could improve conversions by making changes. But like most companies, they did not know what changes to make.\nSo, they began the process by gathering feedback from customers as well as in-store staff and other customer support executives. Analysis of these insights led them to conclude that their existing Weddings page did not provide a lot of the information potential customers were looking for. The team felt that that if they could get prospects to submit enquiries through the website, trained customer support staff could provide specific and relevant answers that in turn would help improve conversion rates.\nThis is how Majestic Wines’ wedding services page (control) originally looked:\nBefore making any changes to the website, the team decided to test the following hypotheses:\nReducing distractions like too many outbound links on the webpage can encourage more people to buy from them or submit the enquiry form.\nClearer articulation of their USP in the context of weddings will encourage more people to place orders or at least submit the enquiry form.\nA video that explains their services will boost conversion rates.\nThe Majestic Wines team could have used multivariate testing. But with so many changes to be made, they concluded that testing so many elements individually would be quite time consuming, especially if they needed results that were statistically significant.\nInstead, the team decided to launch a new, completely redesigned webpage and test for conversions. This was how the newly-designed webpage looked:\nMajestic Wines new design version 1\nThe following main changes were made as part of the redesign:\nReduced clutter: The links originally on the right sidebar were shifted to the end of the page, so they were visible only to those visitors who were interested in that information. This reduced the risk that the links would distract visitors and potential customers.\nCrisp Heading and Content: The new heading emphasized the value proposition to the clients with greater clarity. The new content was lot more engaging, because it showed a higher level of empathy with customers by directing them to the enquiry page and listing questions they might need help with before placing the order. The rewritten copy and the increased size of the subheadings did a better job of answering the “What’s in it for me” question for visitors and prospects.\nBetter images: More relevant images with better color contrast improved website aesthetics.\nClear Call-to-Actions: The clear call to actions and their placement on the top, middle, and bottom of the page made it easier for visitors to locate and get to the enquiry page (without spending much time on this task).\nVideo included: A visually-appealing video explained to users how they should proceed.\nThe redesigned webpage delivered a discrete improvement in conversion rates.\nWebsite optimization is a continuous process, so the team went ahead and removed another distraction that still seemed to affect conversion rates, the Download PDF Party Planner button right next to their Make an Enquiry Now CTA button at the bottom of the page.\nThis is how the final version of the redesigned webpage looked:\nConclusion: 201% increase in Enquiry Form Submissions Followed by a Further 37% Lift\nThe first test resulted in a 201% improvement in the goal conversion rate (enquiry form submission) with statistical significance of 99.99%.\nThe removal of the Download PDF Party Planner button further boosted submission of enquiry forms by 36.9% with a 99.99% statistical significance.\nShown below are the original Majestic Wines webpage and the redesigned versions.",

        "raw_contents": "About Micro Focus\nMicro Focus is one of the most sought out names in the Digital Transformation realm. With a rich history of nearly five decades, this FTSE 250 software group has helped thousands of organizations in their quest to succeed in an ever-evolving marketplace. Their key offering involves delivering consultancy and IT solutions that expedite organizational innovation cycles\nMicro Focus has been using VWO for their optimization efforts since 2016. Championing their optimization efforts is a team consisting of David, Jessica, Rose, and Vandan. The team is focused on building a culture of experimentation across all their digital properties – the main website  (Microfocus.com) and their multiple sub-domains – Community, Tech Beacon (content), and Marketplace (apps, e-learning & add-ons).\nGoals\nAcross the myriad tests that the team has run across the websites, the central theme has always been around the actionability of tests and seeing that they ultimately move the needle.\nHence improving on home page elements, elements across the revenue pages and the overall user experience have been on top of their experimentation itinerary.  \nObservations\nThe team at Micro Focus took a deep dive into how users were interacting with the various pages and elements. They utilized VWO Insights’ heatmaps, scrollmaps, and session recordings. Based on the qualitative inputs from these features, they had a few observations that they wanted to work upon:\nNot showing asterisk marks on mandatory fields on the form was probably a cause for low conversion rates.\nThe CTA for the Free Trial page was below the fold, probably leading to low conversion rates.\nThe marketplace domain did not have product linkage to specific apps and hence was not sending traffic to Micro Focus product pages (revenue pages).\nTests run\nAfter the team identified all the challenges they wanted to work on, they initiated running a few tests to meet their objectives. These tests are elaborated below:\nTest 1:\nThe team hypothesized that following form best practices will result in increased conversions. The variation in this test was the same form with asterisks added to fields that were mandatory for submission with a “Required field” indicator before the form. Here’s how the control and the variation looked:\nThe test was delivered to 100% of the audience landing on the free trial page and was run as an A/B Test. Traffic was equally split between the control and the variation, and the test ran for 20 days. A 5.89% improvement in form completions was observed with the variation emerging as the winner. The variation was then deployed on the website. \n VWO Form Analytics helps you uncover friction points in your forms. Take a free trial to explore its features. \n  Test 2: \nA consequence of the previous test was that the form became slightly bigger with the CTA moving below the fold. The team hypothesized that moving the CTA of their Free Trial button above the fold will improve the overall conversion rates. To achieve this:\nThey removed their “Contact Us” button on the top right page. This was also an avenue for page visitors to get distracted and even navigate away from this high-value page.\nThe “Start Free Trial!” CTA button was moved into the form block and extra breathing space was removed.\nBoth of these made the CTA move to above-the-fold, as evident in the below previews:\nThe test was set up only for desktop traffic, and 100% of the visitors participated, being run as an A/B Test. The test ran for 15 days with traffic split equally between the control and the variation. A 12.37% uplift in the form completion rate was observed through the test.  The variation emerged as the winner and is now deployed on the website. \n  Test 3:\nThe CRO team at Micro Focus also focuses on their various sub-domains. This test was run on their marketplace sub-domain with the hypothesis that adding Micro Focus product links to related app detail pages will send more traffic to Micro Focus product pages, which are their revenue pages.\nThis was run as a Split URL Test with 100% of the traffic participating in the test, with equal distribution to the control and the variation. The test ran for 15 days with the variation emerging as the winner by delivering a 124.13% increase in traffic being sent to the product pages from the marketplace. You can test website redesign easily with VWO’s Split URL Testing capabilities. Take a free trial to check out for yourself.\n“These VWO tests helped confirm that the new treatment sends more traffic to our revenue-generating product pages.” was the final summation by the Micro Focus product manager.\nConclusion\nThe conversion rate optimization program at Micro Focus is advanced and sophisticated, and the team is always on top of their game, conducting experiments on all their domains. As observed here, Micro Focus has benefited from compounding uplifts through sequential testing. This holistic approach towards experimentation has helped them see the bigger picture and synergize tests.\nWith hundreds of tests already conducted using VWO, the team plans to get more robust with their experimentation program, get more data-oriented, and have a steadily growing pipeline which in turn leads to even better business performance.\n“VWO has been the most comprehensive testing tool I’ve used, and they have the support and services to back it up.” was the closing remark by a beaming Micro Focus product manager.\n   ",

        },
        "raw_contents": "About MedaliaArt\nMedaliaArt is an online art gallery specializing in Caribbean and Latin American art. Their sales process is long (involving phone calls, multiple visits, and others), so they chose to measure and optimize the bounce rate instead of sales conversions.\nFor the holiday season, they had put up a sale where they gave 5–55% discounts on all paintings.\nGoals\nHypothesis\nProviding discounts must pull in more visitors to go through multiple pages on the website, exploring different paintings.\nHowever, the challenge with putting up a Holiday Sale message is where to show it. Displaying it prominently on the home page would make more visitors notice it, but some may find it too intrusive and leave the site immediately. On the other hand, putting it at a not-so-noticeable location may have no effect at all. So, what could be the best position on page to display the Holiday Sale (or for that matter any other promotional) message?\nThey wanted to determine the best location on the homepage to put up that message, to optimize for reduced bounce rate.\nTests run\nOnly a split URL test could answer that.\nMedaliaArt set up a split test to optimize their website for bounce rate. First, they created a couple of versions of the home page with Holiday Sale displayed at different locations. Of all versions, the following represented the 2 extremes:\nThe first displayed in big, red font prominently on the home page.\nVariation 1\nThe other, or Variation 2, sidebar Holiday Sale message in small font looked as follows:\nVariation 2\nConclusion\nUsually, split testing tools do not track bounce rate; they rather track the conversion rate (percentage of visitors doing desired action). To track the bounce rate instead, MedaliaArt did a neat trick. They defined a click on any link on the home page as conversion. Thus, the conversion rate of, for example, 40% corresponded to\n100 – 40 = 60% bounce rate.\nSo, which variation had a better bounce rate? Any guesses?\nThey started the test and after 2 weeks, got their first batch of conclusive results.\nMessage location Visitors Clicks (conversions) Conversion Rate Bounce Rate Reduction\nSidebar 145 35 24% 76% N.A.\nIn-your-face 123 49 40% 60% -21%\nThe in-your-face, prominent promotional message had dramatically less bounce rate (60%) than the sidebar one (76%). The reduction in bounce rate of 21% is statistically significant (at 95% confidence level), so the in-your-face variation represents a better version. The improvement in the bounce rate means more interest by visitors in the paintings they are selling and potentially more sales. Request a demo to have a better understanding about the product.\nTakeaways for MedaliaArt/eCommerce stores optimizing for promotional messages:\nHave a variation with no Holiday Sale messaging: If they had a variation with no ‘Holiday Sale’ messaging, it would have provided a benchmark to see the effect of the sales message, irrespective of the position.\nTest message text also: Instead of testing the message location, it will be wise to see the effect of text in the message as well. Maybe a message with the word discount (such as 55% discount on paintings this holiday season) will work better than the default one (Holiday Sale).\nOptimize for sales or purchases: While optimizing for the bounce rate is fine, a better metric would be to measure and optimize for sales, which is what really matters for an eCommerce site.\nWhat eCommerce stores can benefit from this success story?\nSplit testing is the only way to really know what will work and what won’t. Testing is essential to check assumptions related to promotional messages, checkout process, product category ordering, buy now button, and others. Be a little adventurous and test radically different home page designs and ideas. You can always choose to include only a small percentage of traffic and can disable non-performing variations at the click of a button.\nSo, what’s your excuse for not using split testing for increasing sales for your eCommerce store?

The exceptional tool is at the core of the agile optimization process that we have created with Hype.\nAhmet Hoşgör\nDigital Marketing Specialist at Garanti Payment Systems\nObservations\nTo avail the bank’s Bonus Credit Card services, customers have to fill an application form on the website itself.\nGetting into the nitty-gritty of the entire process, Hype found that the application procedure was too lengthy and complex, which made most of the users leave their forms incomplete and abandon the site.  \nTests run\nBased on their research, Hype found some classic ways to decrease form abandonment and increase credit card applications. Firstly, they suggested that the application form should only ask for the most relevant information from the users. Secondly, they wanted to add a sticky banner on the website’s landing page that highlighted the merits of the Bonus Card and allowed users interested in the card apply directly from the banner itself by providing the most relevant information. For this test, they decided to go ahead with the second idea.\nThe test: 3 variations of the sticky banner were created to be tested for the visitors. All the variations asked for the citizenship ID number and phone number for users to access the form. Hype suggested alterations in the informative text placed next to the input boxes in each of its variations. This is what control looked like:\nHere, the CTA directed users to the application page. Hype changed this to enable the user to directly apply from the banner.  \nVariation 1: The first variation informed the users about the bank’s offers. For instance, “There are more than 300 offers every month for the Bonus Credit Card users.” This is what variation 1 looked like:\nVariation 2: In the second variation, Hype added a text saying, “Our customer service agents are available at the moment. They will call you back on the entered phone number.” This is what variation 2 looked like:\nVariation 3: In the last variation, the banner read, “Garanti Payment Systems’s Bonus Card is the most beloved credit card of Turkey since last 8 years.” This is what variation 3 looked like:\nResult: Hype ran the test for about 18 days, wherein a total of 119,000 visitors were engaged. The first variation with banner copy saying, “There are more than 300 offers every month for the Bonus Credit Card users,” increased the number of applications received by 24%. While the other two variations were unable to match the pace.\nWe have been working with Garanti Bonus for their conversion optimization needs. We have been intensively doing A/B tests and customizations to increase their conversions for a long time. We use VWO in this process since it has powerful features and makes implementations easier. By using VWO’s advanced features in our A/B tests, we increased credit card applications by 24%.\nCavide Pala\nConversion Optimization Team Lead\nConclusion\nGaranti Payment Systems decided to go live with variation 1 for its Bonus Credit Card. The winning variation is now served to all the users and is constantly being optimized through continuous testing to increase the conversion rate even further.",

They sell vegan, veggie, and hypoallergenic food for dogs, cats, and horses in Germany, Poland, and France.\nFoodforPlanet is their in-house agency responsible for offline and online marketing activities and has trusted VWO for all the conversion and experience optimization of JOSERA since 2019. We got in touch with Tobias Popp, their Online Marketing Manager, to learn all about their most recent experimental win.\nGoals\nTobias and the team wanted to change the product detail addressing users who had no intention to buy. This implied a reduction in bounce rate while improving their conversions on the product detail page of JOSERA Kids. JOSERA Kids is a special growth formula for medium and large dog breeds. The low-energy recipe with a tailored protein and fat content supports a moderate growth rate, powerful bone development, and healthy joints. It is best suitable for dogs older than 8 weeks, heavily-built, and supports cardiovascular functions and skeletal development.\nObservations\nUsing Google Analytics and other data analytics tools, Tobias and his team at FoodforPlanet identified that the bounce rate on JOSERA’s product detail pages was alarmingly high. An even bigger concern was that sales (conversion rates) were extremely low.\nTests run\nTobias is a firm believer of what every conversion and experience optimization expert advocates – believe in data and in data alone. He uses various scientific models to optimize JOSERA’s website like the LIFT model, 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design, and so on.\nTobias and the team worked on a new product detail page for JOSERA Kids with the objective in mind and employed the above-mentioned models. While the earlier product detail page (control) had the details mentioned in a very tactical, point-wise fashion incorporating multiple colors (for headline and description), the new one (variation) was sleeker with a crisper description.\nThe control was put against the variation in the form of an A/B Test that was powered through VWO. 2,400 visitors became a part of the A/B test, which ran for 16 days. Traffic was equally split between the two experiences and delivered through VWO Testing. \nThe variation recorded a staggering 28.79% increase in conversions.\nHere’s a comparison image of the control and variation for your reference:\nIf I stubbornly use a scientific model and don’t act according to my best conscience, then I will achieve more success. VWO SmartStats help me make statistical decisions and stick to science! \nTobias Popp\nOnline Marketing Manager\nSmartStats, VWO’s Bayesian-powered statistics engine is engineered to compute accurate, data-driven results to help you make the right business decisions. Take our 30-day free trial to conduct A/B tests and get easily interpretable results.\nConclusion\nJOSERA is now serving the variation to the entire traffic. This is also powered by VWO – 100% traffic directed to the variation. Tobias wants to run many more tests on JOSERA’s product detail pages, learn from each of them, remove the control, and run the variation, as practiced in the current case.\nVWO gives you the ease and confidence to validate your test ideas before you ship them.

They offer personalized stamps with text, date, logo, custom design, graphic, signature, and more in all shapes and sizes. RubberStamp.net uses laser-engraving technology that gives a crisp, clear impression of design and text on the stamp.\nRubberStamps.net has been using VWO to optimize their website experience since 2018. We got in touch with Gwendolyn Lee, President, and Owner at RubberStamps.net, to learn all about a recent A/B test that resulted in the improvement of their revenue per (new) visitor.\nFun fact: Revenue Per Visitors (RPV) was not the only metric that RubberStamp.net improved through this test. They also registered a number of small, unanticipated wins!\nGoals\nRubberStamps.net has been catering to many loyal, long-time customers since its inception. But, as a .net domain and a non-big box store, the team wanted to make some changes to their website that would ensure that even new visitors trust their brand and increase the Revenue Rer (new) Visitor (RPV).\nObservations\nAccording to RubberStamps.net’s Google Analytics data, the revenue per visitor (RPV) of the homepage landings was reasonably lower than other landing pages. While RubberStamps.net had positive customer reviews on the homepage, they were below the fold. Only 25% of visitors scrolled down to reach the reviews.\nTests run\nThe team at RubberStamps.net often use website heatmaps to gather visitor behavior data and look for outliers regarding bounce, revenue per visitor, time on site, exit, and so on. To see how website heatmaps work, take a 30-day free trial today.\nThe heatmaps and clickmaps included with each test variation provide a huge amount of additional value and data for the next steps and tests.\nGwendolyn Lee\nPresident and Owner\nThey also occasionally attend webinars or use services like usability testing services for new, insightful feedback and testing ideas. The idea for the test discussed here also came from a website-review webinar about an unrelated ecommerce site, similar to this website review webinar hosted by VWO.\nThe team wanted to test if the aforementioned difference in RPV:\nWas a result of other category or product pages being further down the purchase funnel, thereby, creating a higher revenue per visitor\nOr if there were other adjustments on the homepage that could create a higher RPV\nThe team at RubberStamps.net hypothesized that doubling the review star size above their text reviews would increase trust and confidence, thereby increasing value per visitor or revenue per visitor. This is what the control and variation looked like:\nResults: Before the test, the RPV for control stood at $4.99. 6,000 visitors became a part of the test, which ran for 9 days, and the metric tracked was revenue per (new) visitor (RPV). The variation registered a 33.20% statistically significant increase in RVP to $6.64 as compared to the control. There were also mini, unanticipated wins that came out of the test with conversion rates going up by 6.1% and average order value (AOV) by 25.6%. Even the percentage of visitors scrolling down to the reviews section increased by 20%.\nStart a free trial today for gathering deep insights about your visitors’ behavior.\nConclusion\nAfter witnessing the many breakthroughs in the test discussed above, the team at RubberStamps.net has many tests planned for the future like testing other high-traffic landing pages with similar format changes to determine if revenue per (new) visitor (RPV) increases on these pages as well like it did on the homepage. And VWO is happy to be a part of their experience optimization journey.\nAbsolutely love it – VWO has taken our website testing to a whole new level.\nGwendolyn Lee\nPresident and Owner",

        "raw_contents": "About Express Watches\nExpress Watches, a venture of the Ashleigh Jewellers of Woodbridge, Suffolk (UK), is an authorized dealer of Seiko watches. The company has shipped watches to customers in 23 countries.  \nThe company hired a digital marketing agency High Position (since acquired by Semetrical) to optimize its website. High Position, one of our Certified Partners, uses VWO to help its clients optimize their websites.\nGoals: Increasing Purchases\nExpress Watches had a neatly-designed website that displayed trust badges for credibility. It  promised next-day delivery within the UK and offered a 30-day refund. However, sales were not in line with expectations.\nThis was in part due to the problem of replica watches that had been plaguing the watch retail business. The problem had become especially severe for online watch sellers, with people questioning the authenticity of watches being sold. Mistrust and confusion were fuelled by websites selling replicas at prices that represented 70–80% discounts to the price of authentic watches.\nExpress Watches used Qualaroo to conduct a user survey to gather major concerns. The survey revealed that visitors were looking for assurance around questions such as the following:\nIs the company/website legitimate?\nAre they offering the best price?\nWill the watch they ordered be the real deal or a cheap replica?\nIs safe and quick delivery assured?\nAre the online payment methods safe?\nThe survey findings reinforced the need for Express Watches to make sure that its website was perceived as trustworthy and reliable. As “Express Watches” in itself was not a major brand, it was vital for them to differentiate themselves from fly-by-night websites.\nThe prominently placed the Seiko Authorized Dealer badge, as well as the small green Trust Pilot badge on product pages, helped build some credibility around product authenticity and the reasonableness of pricing.\nNote the Authorized Dealer badge in the header and several reasons listed under the “Why buy from Express Watches?” section (in the right corner) in the control version of one of the product pages shown below:\nWhile the 2-year Seiko warranty and the 30-day refund policy did address some of the concerns that visitors had, the survey findings left them with no doubt that they had to do more to build trust. Many visitors were simply not willing to purchase online merely on the basis of “words” or “claims” shown on the site. Clearly, Express Watches needed more objective and credible proof to convince customers about the authenticity of its website content.\nThey came up with the solution of adding customer reviews on all product pages of the site. But the problem with testimonials was that anyone could display some “testimonials.” There was no way for visitors to know if the testimonials themselves were genuine.\nThis is what guided Express Watches to the hypothesis for this test. With VWO Surveys, you can receive qualitative insights into visitor behavior on your website. You can validate the hypotheses created based on these insights with VWO’s A/B testing capabilities. Take a free trial to explore all capabilities of VWO.\nTests run: Add the Trust Pilot Widget to the Product Pages\nThe hypothesis was that the addition of the larger Trust Pilot widget to the website would help reduce buyer anxieties among visitors and hence increase sales from the site. The site-wide change of including the larger Trust Pilot widget on all product pages was implemented site-wide.\n\nAs shown below in the variation page for one of the product pages, the widget displayed some great customer reviews from the Trust Pilot website:\nThe tagline “Trust Pilot Says Our Customers Love Us” added just above the widget and right below the Add to Basket CTA button seemed to be perfect to draw the attention of potential customers to the widget just when it was needed- right before the checkout.\nThe A/B test was set up and run on the VWO – a/b testing platform. The test ran for over 2 months, with thousands of visitors participating.\nConclusion: 58.29% Increase in Sales\nThe variation beat the original, with purchases increasing by 58.29%. The statistical significance was 99%.\nHere is the comparison image showing the 2 versions and the changes made to the variation:\nThe test confirmed that the variation more effectively addressed concerns that earlier hindered the purchase decision. But it also made clear that merely including basic trust elements such as customer testimonials, reviews, or trust badges on a website may not be enough.\nThe widget from Trust Pilot authenticated the credibility of the reviews and hence amplified their impact, allowing prospects to move forward into the funnel.\nA/B test the copy, design, and position of social proof on important landing pages of your website with VWO.

        "raw_contents": "About Bag Servant\n  Bag Servant caters to the needs of online handbag shoppers by offering them selections from established brands as well as upcoming designers. It also offers features such as interactive bag customization.\nThe company used VWO, the a/b testing tool, to test website optimization possibilities to improve conversion.\nGoals: Increasing Conversions (Click-throughs to affiliate websites)\nThe company’s business model was based on marketing products of affiliates. Thus, being a part of the conversion funnel, a primary need was to ensure that the Bag Servant website increased click-throughs to product sites.\nTests run: Adding the Right Trust Badge to Boost Credibility\nTo earn revenue; it was vital that the site is effective not only in persuading visitors to complete the purchase successfully but also increasing their average order value (AOV).\nAround the time when the Bag Servant team was grappling with this challenge, Tim Ash’s book Landing Page Optimization came out. After reading it, the Bag Servant team wondered about the credibility and trust of their website—the absence of which was identified in Tim’s book as one of the “seven deadly sins of landing page design.”\nUntil then, the team had focused on testing website elements such as the copy of headlines and CTA buttons, button size, color and so on. The lack of credibility and trust was seen as a major gap and gave Bag Servant’s A/B testing endeavors in an entirely new direction.\nThe team started to build its website credibility by leveraging the power of social proof. The company’s Twitter account boasted of 4,000+ followers, and they used this to convince visitors to the website. This change improved conversion rates, assuring the team that they were headed in the right direction.\nGiven below is the control page on which the above change was made:\nThe team then decided to A/B test the original (which displayed the 4,000+ Twitter count badge) against a version that replaced the number of Twitter followers with a WOW badge—a relatively hard-to-get badge presented by a renowned businesswoman.\nThe hypothesis was that the WOW badge would convey a higher level of trust and credibility than just the count of followers on Twitter.\nThis is what the variation page looked like:\nThe A/B testing was done using VWO platform. The test was set up to track the following 3 goals:\nGoal #1: Visits to Affiliate Partner Sites\nGoal #2: Site Engagement\nGoal #3: Product Exploration\nConclusion: 72% Increase in Visits to Affiliate Websites; 10% Improvement in Site Engagement\nThe results proved the hypothesis that the WOW badge did increase engagement and conversions.\nVisits to affiliate partners’ websites marked a 72.05% of improvement with the results having 98% statistical confidence.\nSite engagement saw a boost of 10.27%, with 98% chance to beat the original\nProduct exploration on the home page saw an increase of 60.42%; however, the statistical confidence for this goal was only 93%.\nThis is the comparison image that shows the control and variation versions of the test:\nIn hindsight, implementing “best practices” seems a no-brainer. But this decision isn’t as simple as it may sound. This is because the context of the page makes a huge difference to test results.\nIndeed, if the change is not made to the right page or in the right context of buyer psychology, the change may actually not deliver expected results. The effectiveness of a “proven practice” may well be invalidated.\nBag Servant sought to increase trust with customers by adding the Versign Seal and the Twitter Follow badge in two different variation pages of its search page. But both variation pages got them negative results for all the 3 goals mentioned above.\nIt is important to formulate robust hypotheses and test these adequately before making any change to the website permanent.",

Buyakilt.com A/B tested the inclusion of a filter on their product pages, allowing visitors to “slice and dice” through all the options available and quickly arrive at what they wanted to buy, helping the website increase revenues by a whopping 76%.\nHere’s a case from UK Tool Centre for you which shows how benefits can be accrued by removing a product filter.\nGoals\nAlthough filters are found all over the web and are almost de rigueur for eCommerce websites, the folks at UK Tool Centre theorized that for this specific category (a brand of woodcare products called Cuprinol), the filter menu was unnecessarily adding extra options to the page which wasn’t required.\nTests run\nHere is the page on which the UK Tool Centre team conducted the test. This page had a filter menu for all products just above the Cuprinol listing.\nIn the variation, the filter menu was removed from the category, the hypothesis being that when focused on a particular product, a user did not need the menu to distract him/her away from it.\nConclusion\nA surprising increase of 27% in engagement on the product page. What happened was that visitors were less distracted by the filter and the easy option of leaving the page that it provided. This increased site engagement meaning they clicked around more and had a better look at all the products on the page.\nLearning Points\nDon’t distract your visitors with unnecessary options and try to provide them exactly what they want. When they are looking for something, give them the tools to make that search a breezy affair. After they have found it, let them stay and look around undisturbed by other options.\nAlso, we cannot stress enough the importance of regular testing. Buyakilt.com experienced an increase in conversion rate when they added a product filter, but UK Tool Centre saw the increase after removing the filter. This just goes to show that there are no hard and fast rules and you should run tests to see what works best on your site.",

Now available in 27 different languages, GetResponse operates globally with offices in Poland, the U.S., Canada, Malaysia, and Russia. They offer a complete suite of simple-yet-powerful solutions, scaled and customized for small and large companies.\nThey weren’t sure whether having a Free Trial option along with the paid sign-up option would work for them. They used VWO to test for the same on their platform website.\nGoals\nGetResponse wanted to test if adding a Free Trial button on the home page will influence the number of purchases of paid accounts and number of registrations of free accounts.\nThere was a perception that providing a Free Trial button can decrease the number of sign-ups so it was quite a critical test.\nTests run\nThey prominently placed a Buy Now call to action button on their home page. They also have a Free Trial plan, but it was not available on the home page and could only be found on certain pages.\nHere’s how their home page looked like (notice the prominent Buy Now button):\nOriginal home page\nThey used VWO to quickly set up an A/B test in which variation had an extra Free Trial button next to the Buy Now button.\nHere’s how the variation looked like (note the 2 prominent buttons):\nVariation: 158% increase in trial sign-ups\nConclusion\nThe results they found after running the test were astonishing. GetResponse noticed that by adding free trial buttons on home page, the number of free accounts increased by 158.6%, while there was no negative influence on the number of paid accounts created on the home page. That was a strong proof in favor of providing a Free Trial button on the home page itself.\nAbout the lessons that couold be derived from this test, Agnieszka Dabrowska, Brand Manager, GetResponse Brand Manager, said:\n“It’s worth testing different variations of Call to Action (CTA) on the home page. We expected that by adding a free trial button on the home page, the number of paid accounts would decrease. We were positively surprised by the results. Not only did we manage to keep the sale at the same level, but we also noticed a huge increase in the number of free trial accounts, which will also result in a bigger number of upgrades in the future.”\nVWO is a great tool that lets us test different variations of the homepage on a small sample of visitors. Thanks to VWO, we managed to find out the perfect combination of CTAs on GetResponse homepage and increase the overall conversion.\nAgnieszka Dabrowska\nBrand Manager",

We often either rely on the advice of construction workers or on online reviews. So, imagine the confusion a visitor will face when he needs to choose between ? Most visitors won’t know terms such as single or double bubble insulation and even if they find out, won’t be able to take a call on what would work best for them.\nIn this success story, EcoFoil, a leading supplier of radiant barrier and foil bubble insulation in North America, tries to help its website visitors facing a similar situation as above.\nGoals\nOn its website home page, the Clickstop team has a Help section, which said Need Help Finding The Right Product? This section linked to a virtual map and that helped visitors figure out what product they needed, depending on which part of their home they were trying to insulate.\nTo ensure maximum benefit for most visitors, they used VWO to test different positions of this section on their home page.\nTests run\nIn the original design of their home page, the position of this Help section was below the fold where users had to scroll down to see it. Also, with another section adjacent to it, often it wasn’t noticeable.\nHere’s how their home page looked:\nControl (Help section center below the fold)\nThe team at Clickstop thought it would be better to put the Help section above the fold where even new visitors could see it without having to scroll down the page. So, they conducted an A/B test using VWO.\nHere’s how the variation looked:\nVariation (Help box moved to left sidebar, above the fold)\nConclusion\nThe team found that the variation indeed worked better. Much to their surprise, the variation with the Help section above the fold showed an improvement of 86% in purchases over the Control.\nNeedless to say, EcoFoil were excited about such an upswing in sales. Kendra Smith of EcoFoil also mentioned that VWO was crucial to help her confirm her hypothesis of increasing conversions by moving the help box above the fold on the webpage.",

It provides state-of-the-art digital services including planning coherent digital strategies, designing pixel-perfect websites and mobile apps, running A/B tests, and crafting innovative solutions that help businesses prosper. Since its inception, the company has helped many brands achieve their online ambitions using sophisticated yet tactical marketing means. \nU-Digital relies on VWO to manage the conversion optimization programs of its clientele. In a conversation with Thomas van Zeelst, Online Marketer at U-Digital, regarding his experience using the VWO Experience Optimization Platform, we requested him to shed some light on his testing experiences. We also asked Thomas to share one of the successful A/B test campaigns they’ve run so far.\nGoals\nU-Digital has a broad client base. One of their clients, a reputable skin care eCommerce store, has a keen inclination towards A/B testing owing to the possible impact it can bring about. \nWhile analyzing the overall conversions of the client’s website, Thomas and the team noticed that mobile conversion rates were less than that of the desktop and started focusing on improving the mobile conversion rates. \nObservations\nNot knowing the exact reason for the low performance of mobile pages, Thomas and his team spent a considerable amount of time studying the performance of each of the product pages of the client’s website. They analyzed page values using Google Analytics and used VWO Heatmaps to identify friction areas and underperforming conversion-fetching page elements. You can take a 30 day free trial with VWO to explore heatmaps and other insightful features.\n  Usually, through these analyses, the team at U-Digital gets insights, which they then use for testing and experimentation. Similarly, in this case, they had some observations and based on which, they ideated on various improvements that could help drive up the mobile conversion rates. The only way to be sure was to test out these ideas. \nTests run\nIn its existing form, the Add-to-Cart button was not sticky and would go out of sight when scrolled. The team at U-Digital hypothesized that the click-through rate to the shopping cart would increase on mobile when the button is locked at the bottom of the page.  The team then focused their attention on fixing it.\nThe Test\nWith a strong hypothesis, Thomas and the team set up an A/B test on VWO. They ran the test on all the product pages, which matched a certain pattern and excluded some URLs to keep the test precise. All the traffic coming on the targeted pages were included with an equal split between the control and the variation. \nHere’s how the control and the variation looked:\n  U-Digital Control vs Variation\nThe metric tracked through the A/B test was click-through rate to the shopping cart triggered through product pages. The experiment ran for approximately 23 days, and 7,200 visitors became a part of the test. The variation won the test with a 21.46% jump in overall mobile conversions. \nI love A/B testing using VWO. It makes it possible to make a big difference in revenue and conversion rate.\nThomas van Zeeist\nOnline Marketer\nConclusion\nBased on the results, the variation has been implemented. The team has now begun testing shrink product images. They’re also looking forward to using these learnings to study other important eCommerce pages and improving their overall performance.

        "raw_contents": "About Masters ITC Software\nScanitto Pro is an easy-to-use scanning software for Windows that allows users to easily save scanned documents in a variety of formats including pdf.\nThe company uses VWO for its optimization testing.\nGoals: Increasing the Number of Software Downloads\nOn its landing page, the company offered visitors the choice of a free trial download as well as purchasing a paid version of the software.\nThis is what the original landing page looked like:\nThere were two CTA buttons right next to each other. The company wanted to increase the number of visitors who purchased the paid version, that is, click-throughs to the Buy Now button.\nTests run: Removing the Buy Now Button to Encourage Use of Free Version\nThe Scanitto team thought it would be easier to convince people to buy the product if they could first get them to try it for free. As an exploratory test, they wanted to track change in visitor behavior if the Buy Now button was removed from the Scanitto Pro landing page.\nThey thus created the following variation page in which the Buy Now button was removed:\nThis variation was A/B tested against the original (control) by using the VWO platform. \nConclusion: 29.75% Increase in Free Downloads\nThe team’s hypothesis was proved right. Removing the Buy Now button increased the number of visitors downloading the free version of Scanitto Pro by 29.75%. The statistical confidence associated with the results was 97%.\nThe image below shows a comparison of the 2 versions and highlights the change that was made:\nMost of us assume that the more closely a call-to-action button directly relates to the topline or bottomline of the company, the higher it should rank on the priority list. But a closer analysis will reveal that the primary call to action button must reflect the business model of the company- after all, unless potential customers buy the product or service, there will be no top line (or bottom line).\nThe trend of placing 2 call-to-action (CTA) buttons together is catching on, with many websites using this design. The idea behind this is that if visitors are not yet ready to take action with the primary call-to-action, the secondary CTA may pique their interest enough to know more about the product/service. The expectation is that these prospects will convert after they get to know the product better.\nBut placing the 2 CTAs together does not always work. By providing visitors a choice of 2 buttons, they are making their customers think. This completely contradicts the basic website usability principle of not making your visitors think too much. Don’t Make Me Think by Steve Crug is an interesting book that explores how you can increase conversion rates of your website by reducing the thinking effort of site visitors.\nThat’s why Scanitto’s single CTA approach worked. It reduced the decision-making visitors had to do. After users had downloaded the free version and found how easy to use, convenient, and useful the product was, they came back to buy the paid version.",

        "raw_contents": "About Royal Discount\nRoyal Discount sells computer software and related products from companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Monster Cable, and Symantec at discounted prices.\nTo improve the conversion rate of its website, the company hired Fruition.net, which used VWO for testing.\nGoals\nThe objective was to increase clicks on Add to Cart, thereby increasing sales.\nTests run\nPrice is critical to influencing prospects to click the CTA, in this case, Add to Cart. Based on previous A/B tests, especially as a seller of discounted products, Fruition had included the crossed-out the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) figure on Royal Discount’s product pages, a move that had boosted conversion rates slightly.\nThis is what control looked like:\nAs part of the ongoing optimization process, Team Fruition felt that due to the other text on the page, the price information was not getting the required attention. Even though the Add to Cart call-to-action button stood out, they felt that visitors were probably missing out on why they should purchase from the Royal Discount website.\nThe team hypothesized that increasing the emphasis on the discounted price shown on the page would increase conversions. They created a variation for the Microsoft Office 2013 page and pitted it against the original. The font size of the discounted sale price was increased from 15 px to 20 px, and the font type was made bold. The crossed out MSRP figure continued to be shown as before.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nFruition.net set up the A/B test by using VWO.  Add to Cart and the final purchase were the 2 goals tracked. The test was run for more than 1 month.\nConclusion\nThe variation resulted in 36.54% more visitors clicking the Add to Cart CTA and hence moving further into the conversion funnel. In turn, this increased revenue by 10.21%, although the statistical significance for this goal wasn’t met initially.\nSo why did this simple change work? For conversion-centered design, it is important to know which page elements will have the greatest impact on prospects’ decision-making- and thereafter, ensure that these elements easily get the attention of visitors. This often means increasing font size, changing font type, using contrasting colors or changing their placement on the page.\nAuthenticity and price are typically the most important factors that drive decision-making. When buying popular and standard software such as Microsoft Office, most people are not too concerned about pictures or detailed product descriptions.\nBy making its discounted price stand out clearly, Royal Discount made it easy for visitors to spot the key “value lever” and made it easier for them to proceed with the purchase.",

        "raw_contents": "About Lyyti\nLyyti.com is a Finland-based software company that specializes in providing SaaS-based event management solutions. It uses VWO solutions to test optimization opportunities for its website.\nGoals\nThe main objective for Lyyti.com to employ A/B testing was to increase the number of visitors clicking the Free Trial CTA button.\nTests run\nThe pricing page is one of the most critical pages for any website selling products or services. This is especially so for a SaaS business such as Lyyti, because this page is where serious buyers are likely to spend a lot of time.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nAnalysis of the website by using VWO heatmaps and clickmaps indicated that users frequently moved between the pricing and the features page. Feedback from the sales team suggested that the short descriptions provided on the pricing page did not clearly convey the features offered in various plans.\nBased on the above information, Sampsa Vainio, conversion optimization expert, concluded that the original pricing page was not very user-friendly and needed to be redesigned.\nThe team decided to run an A/B test to test the hypothesis that prominently displaying the features of all plans and having multiple CTA buttons would increase visits to the free trial sign-up page and consequently, increase sign-ups.\nTwo different variations of the pricing page were created and served evenly to visitors. The test was run for a period of over 5 months.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nConclusion: 93% increase in click-throughs\nThe variation won, increasing visits to the lead generation page by 93.71%, with a statistical significance of 96%.\nHere’s a quick comparison of the original and the challenger:\nThe variation clearly showed features offered in each plan.\nThe optimization of pricing pages can give an immediate lift to your revenue. As Sampsa explained: “The LTV (Lifetime Value) of a single user who converts into a paid customer is pretty high for us, normally in the thousands of dollars. Also, the value is high since users who purchase a license usually stay with us for several years. All in all, the 94% increase will definitely be seen in our sales and we’ll do our best in converting those free users into paying customers.”\nIt is useful to understand why the variation performed better. The variation beat the original, because it included at least 3 elements that were missing in the original:\n1) Features clearly tabulated in the pricing plan\nThe new design clearly mentioned the features of each plan. Since the features were mentioned right next to the pricing, it was easier for the prospects to make a decision. Also, the variation clearly presented the additional features associated with higher plans—something that was missing in the original design.\n2) Multiple CTAs were saying the same thing\nThe variation had 5 more CTA buttons than the original, asking visitors to sign up for a free trial. In the original design, the message, “Try all the features and experience all the benefits of Lyyti for free” was buried in the plan description and thus not immediately noticeable. On the other hand, each plan in the variation had a free trial CTA button above and below it. Thus, the message that visitors were offered all the features in the free trial period became even more prominent.\n3) Shifting the focus of the page to one purpose\nIn the old design, there were 4 CTA buttons of the same size, giving 2 different messages. In the challenger, there were 6 CTA buttons, all giving out a single message. The other CTA message—Request a Quote was made into a link and moved below the main CTA buttons.\nNow the page had just one purpose – ask visitors to sign up for a free trial.\nWe soon realized that asking for a quote might be asking too much since our company is not that known outside of Finland (which is our main market at the moment).That’s why we shifted the focus of the main goal of the page —> sign up for a free trial.\nSampsa Vainio\nConversion Optimization Expert\nKey Takeaways\n1) One page, one purpose. There should be absolutely no element of distraction or point of conflict between choices for visitors. Having multiple goals confuses visitors and can lead to a drop in conversions.\n2) Learn about your visitors from all mediums possible. Studying their behavior from your analytics tool, discussions with your sales and support teams, or even speaking directly to them will give you valuable insights.\n3) Don’t shy away from making tough changes, even redesigning a page. (See how CrazyEgg redesigned their homepage to improve conversion rate by 363%)\n4) Absolutely never, ever, forget to test!",

The hypothesis was that this change will lead more visitors to read the information on pricing, which can lead more of them to place orders, that is, conversions would increase.\nAccordingly, a Challenger page was created and tested against the control (original page) by using the VWO platform.

        "raw_contents": "About Elegant Steps\nElegant Steps sells wedding shoes in the UK, both online and in store. More than 50% of its customers are females, a bulk of whom are brides-to-be looking for wedding shoes.\nGoals\nBased on the GA data, Elegant Steps wanted to optimize the mobile version of its website and increase conversion rates for mobile users.\nObservations\nA study of the Google Analytics (GA) data of Elegant Steps revealed that while its desktop website was converting at 2%, conversions through the mobile version were much lower, at about 0.6%.\nTests run\nHit Search, the company’s digital marketing agency, wanted to dig deep into the lower conversion through the mobile web site. Using GA data, heuristics, and VWO’s scrollmaps and heatmaps solutions, they found that:\nHardly any visitors scrolled to reach the Shop by Brand section on the home page.\nElegant Steps’ 3 main USPs, which included free shipping, did not appear above the fold on mobile devices.\nText across the home page image was hard to read because it was the same color as the background.\nThis is how the original home page looked on mobile:\nArmed with the above findings, Niall Brooke from Hit Search set about optimizing the mobile home page to enhance site appeal. The team decided to:\nIntroduce the Shop by Brand section higher up on the page, as the presence of an established name is known to help instil trust and assuage fears.\nMany studies have found that unexpected shipping cost is the biggest reason for cart abandonment. It was hypothesized that displaying “Free Shipping” above the fold will help reduce the bounce rate and encourage users to continue down the conversion funnel.\nChange the CTA copy from the generic “Shop Wedding Shoes” to the more personal “Find my new wedding shoes.”\nChange the text color on the image for the text so that it can be read easily.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nUsing VWO’s targeting capability, Hit Search ran the new version of the home page against the original only for mobile visitors. Niall set VWO’s Bayesian-powered statistics engine to the High-Certainty mode.\nConclusion\nThe results kicked in within a month, and these were highly positive. The mobile conversion rate increased by 200%.\nA delighted Niall said “The results were positive with almost a threefold increase in conversions and almost a 50% drop in the bounce rate.” He was also impressed with how VWO performed for them.\nVWO is a brilliant all-round conversion optimization platform which we use on a daily basis to perform user analysis, A/B and split tests.\nNiall Brooke\nHit Search\n(On behalf of Elegant Steps)",

Rather than timed competitive races, these team-based activities are meant to promote camaraderie and accomplishment as a community.\nTo ensure that enrolment on their mobile website was smooth and easy for their users, Tough Mudder partnered with VWO and altima°, a digital agency specializing in eCommerce.\nGoals\naltima° expected that customers on the mobile might not be able to discover events easily. Therefore, the core objective of taking up the optimization effort was to ensure easy identification of relevant events and seamless sign-ups for users.\nTests run\nTo identify hurdles in the participants’ paths to enrolment, altima° analyzed Tough Mudder’s Google Analytics (GA) data. An analysis of existing rates from the Event List indicated that interested shoppers were not able to identify the events appropriate for them.\nTough Mudder and altima° hypothesized that on the mobile version of the original page, the most relevant pieces of information such as the event location and date were being pushed too far down the fold. In addition, less relevant page elements were possibly distracting the users.\nThis is what the original mobile page looked like:\nClearly, Event Location and Date were way below in the fold. altima° decided to make the following changes to the variation:\n 1. Simplified header: The header copy was limited to focus on the listed events. The following image shows how this looked:\n2. List redesign: Filter and event list were redesigned to prominently feature the events. The list was redesigned to optimize the event location and date. This is what it looked like:\n3. Urgency message to push quicker enrolments:  An urgency message was added to encourage interested users to enrol as the events approached their deadlines. The following image to shows how this was done:\nBased on these 3 variations, 7 different combinations were created. A multivariate test was run by using VWO. The test led to over 2,000 event sign-ups across 4 weeks. The tests also involved addition of social proof like Facebook icons.\nFollowing is the list of combinations that were made:\nConclusion\nAfter 4 weeks, Variation 2, which included the control’s urgency message, header copy, and redesigned event list, had won. This is not to say that other test variations were not successful—just that Variation 2 was the MOST successful. The winning variation produced a session value uplift of 9%! Combined with the next 2 rounds of optimization testing, altima° helped Tough Mudder earn a session value uplift of over 33%!\naltima° attributes the performance of Variation 2 because of the following reasons:\nSocial proof and header copy\nSocial proof demonstrated itself to be a worthy component of conversion optimization initiatives. These often include customer reviews and/or indications of popularity across social networks.\nTough Mudder experienced a significant lift in the session value due to the test involving the addition of Facebook icons. It’s likely that the phrase “Our Events Have Had Over 2 Million Participants Across 3 Continents” warranted its own kind of social proof.\nList redesign\nThe most ambitious testing element from a design and development standpoint was also the most successful.\nIt appeared that an unnecessary amount of real estate was being afforded to the location filter. This was resolved by decreasing margins above and below the filter, along with removing the stylized blue graphic.\nThe events themselves now carried a more prominent position relative to the fold on mobile devices. The list itself was more easily readable, thanks to a light background and nondistracting text.\nUrgency message\nIt was believed that the urgency message would prove to be valuable. The underperformance of this element came as a surprise.\nSomething to consider is that not every event included an urgency message. Also, not every enrolment period was to close soon. Therefore, it may have been the case that customers whose individually relevant events were not closing soon may have put off the decision till later. It might also have been that an urgency message was introduced too early in the steps to event enrolment.\nNonetheless, the experience reinforced the benefits of A/B testing by using specific hypotheses supported by VWO tools.",

        "raw_contents": "About nameOn\nThis success story draws on the original success story written by Steven Macdonald, an advisor at KingsPoint, an agency based in Norway that helps brands like nameOn to increase the conversion rates of their websites.\nnameOn is a major supplier of embroidered personalized gifts in Scandinavia. The company used the VWO platform for conducting a series of A/B tests.\nGoals\nThe objective of this test was to increase visits to the checkout page through the cart page by reducing cart abandonment.\nTests run\nnameOn wanted to improve conversions from its website. Using Google Analytics, the team identified high-value pages based on performance over the past 12 months. Loosely based on the PIE framework from Wider Funnel, this analysis provided valuable insights about which pages should be A/B tested and in what sequence (that is, which pages should be tested first).\nAccordingly, the team set a target of increasing visits from the cart to the checkout page by 10%.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nA review of the original checkout page revealed that there were 9 call-to-actions (CTAs) on it, including Sign up for newsletter, Like us on Facebook, and Go to home page.\nThe hypothesis was that the large number of CTAs on the cart page distracted potential customers, so making the main CTA button stand out would increase the click-throughs to the Continue to checkout button. As a result, more visitors would complete their orders instead of leaving the page.\nThe team created a variation that had no CTAs except for Welcome bonus and Continue to checkout. The color of the button was changed from yellow to blue, to make it clearly stand out from the rest of the page. This is what the variation looked like:\nChoosing the CTA color was taken from the Conversion Optimization: 6 Power Tips of the Trade presentation by Angie Schottmuller, which includes the fantastic clockwork conversion wheel:\nThe test was run for about 6 weeks.\nConclusion\nThe hypothesis was proved right as more people visited the checkout page during the test period. The overall e-commerce conversion rate and average order value both increased. The overall performance saw an 11.40% increase with 99% statistical significance.\nFrom a sales perspective, nameOn considered March to July as “low season” and August to December as “peak season.” Based on Google Analytics data from 30 days prior to the test, the team estimated that a 10% increase in visits to the checkout page would boost monthly sales by more than $8,500, adding up to incremental sales of about $100,000 per year.\nRealizing that using VWO to conduct new tests was a quick process, nameOn followed up the above tests with new A/B tests on its product and category pages.",

        "raw_contents": "About Frictionless Commerce\nFrictionless Commerce is a digital marketing agency that specializes in helping Shopify websites improve sales through the use of buyer psychology techniques to influence and convert new buyers. Led by Rishi Rawat, the firm has been instrumental in improving conversion rates for hundreds of brands over the past 12 years. They have been using VWO since 2012 and typically conduct 1-2 A/B tests per month for every client. \nWe spoke to Rishi to understand the CRO process followed by Frictionless Commerce, to deep dive into a successful experiment that his team performed recently, and to gauge how VWO has helped the team achieve uplifts in revenue for their clients. \nThe agency’s approach to CRO\nAt Frictionless Commerce, the team looks at CRO through the lens of converting first-time buyers. The reason behind focusing on this niche is the observation that first-time buyers behave in remarkably similar ways across industries – so whether they’re buying a house for the first time or a pair of running shoes, the questions they face are largely similar. \nBy A/B testing on new buyers for the last 12 years, most of which was done using VWO, the team has identified 9 key drivers that influence first-time buyer decisions. The conversion copywriting process at Frictionless Commerce is based on these 9 psychological drivers. \nAt the onset of a project, the team’s focus is on identifying the correct selling angle for the client. Rishi believes that finding the right concept and telling the brand story in an engaging way is more important than testing design elements upfront.\nMost case studies revolve around UI/UX changes, but copy changes can lead to incremental improvements that collectively over time bring in huge numbers – this is something that a lot of brands miss out on because they are so focused on testing their UI and UX only\nRishi Rawat\nFounder\nNosediving straight into big design changes is risky\nRishi also believes that at the start of the project, when the client’s trust still remains to be earned, making big design and layout changes can deteriorate progress and get you entangled in a feedback loop. Once the team has tested their concept and copy, brought in the numbers, and thus won the client’s trust, they have evidence to move ahead and test bigger changes.\n“UI/UX changes are more expensive to set up as a test. They can lead to performance issues if not implemented correctly. But the biggest issue with them is that they’re political. A design change on a client’s key page invariably leads to a lot of back and forth even before the actual testing begins.”, he says.\nThe team at Frictionless Commerce, therefore, opt to give a choreographed experience to website visitors. They make micro-level improvements like adding CTAs at strategic positions on the page. When a visitor interacts with one instance of the CTA, the remaining instances disappear. \nThe goal: Improving conversions for a product that’s free\nRishi has observed typically two shopper modalities in eCommerce: skimming and digging. The skimmers browse quickly through information on pages while the diggers like to deep dive and consume content in a detailed fashion.  \nOne of Frictionless Commerce’s clients, Grüum, on a mission to get rid of plastic shampoo bottles, created an offer where they gave one shampoo bar for free. The shampoo bar, wrapped in paper, is a biodegradable alternative to conventional shampoos. \nThe product was free, and the page with the offer on it was already doing well. The goal was to take the conversion rate even higher.\nObservations\nThere were a couple of obstacles in the path to achieving the goal:\nWhile the shampoo bar itself was free, the visitor would still need to bear delivery expenses. This message had to be conveyed to visitors in the most persuasive manner possible without taking away from the joy of receiving a free product. \nThe shampoo industry is a mature one. Grüum, a startup, was taking on large industry players. \nTests run\nThe team hypothesized that building a convincing selling angle around the following aspects in the copy will influence and improve the conversion rate of new buyers:\nFairness is a core value of the brand\nWe have just one planet\nThe shampoo industry will not reform itself anytime soon\nThe 5k+ reviews speak for the product’s quality \nThe test was carried out for both desktop and mobile visitors.\nWhat was changed\nDozens of micro-improvements were made within the copy through annotation and deconstruction of the original page. However, the layout of the page was not disturbed. The aim was to reconcile both groups – skimmers and diggers – on the page through its copy. \nThe first thing they focused on was the paid shipping aspect. Instead of putting out the message that the buyer would need to bear the shipping costs, they added a clickable element that would talk about the value of fairness that is important to Grüum and explain why shipping is not free, while also asking visitors if they thought this to be fair. A similar strategy was used to explain why the first shampoo bar is free and to showcase the company’s awards.\nThe second important strategy was adding a button called – The Whole Story – and this was aimed primarily at the diggers. For the diggers who clicked the link, a lightbox would open, telling the entire brand story.\nThe copy spoke about how the readers were part of a minority; thereby grabbing their attention, about how the brand needed their help, why shampoo bottles were bad for the planet, why change was difficult but possible, and how in the past people have changed habits after learning new information. At the end of this, it asked the reader for their thoughts on the brand story. This feedback mechanism has given the team data on the persuasiveness of the copy.\nResult\nThe test ran for 5 weeks and nearly 25,000 new visitors became a part of it. With a 5.97% increase in conversion rate, 2,778 new orders were generated. (VWO makes A/B tests easy with its SmartStats feature. You can conclude tests faster with accurate results that you can trust without getting into the math behind it. Take a free trial to check this out for yourself.)\nFor Frictionless Commerce, Grüum was a different challenge than others because the product in question was free. \n“Normally the tension on a product page is caused by the price point – and a clever selling angle needs to overcome this tension. But if the product is free – the traditional tensions disappear. You then need to figure out what other elements can be introduced to induce engagement.”, says Rishi.\nConclusion: Why VWO\nRishi believes that for marketers who don’t understand technology, receiving the right technical support becomes crucial.\nWhat has made me stick around with VWO for all these years is that you have the best technical support in the world for any SaaS product. This is the only thing I care about as a marketer – that when I face a technical issue, a competent person will take care of it. Not just send me a link to a help file but actually resolve the issue.\nRishi Rawat\nFounder\nThe team at Frictionless Commerce studies the impact of A/B tests beyond the conversion goals. They want to understand how deep in their sales pitch did the new visitors go and how much of the content did they interact with. They’re able to do this easily with VWO – as it enables them to set up micro-goals on the page and track them as micro-conversions.\nGet deep insights into visitor behavior, formulate hypotheses, plan tests, and set up goals based on your business metrics – all with VWO.

To receive a free brochure, prospective candidates had to fill and submit this form. Here’s how the lead generation page and form originally looked:\nOn evaluating various elements on the website, the agency found that although the website had several good testimonials, they were all on the testimonials page; none of these was shown on the lead generation page.\nRealizing the importance of testimonials as a source of “social proof” for prospects, the team hypothesized that adding testimonials to the lead generation page would encourage more prospects to request the brochure.\nUsing the VWO platform, the agency ran a split URL test on the lead generation page to test the underlying hypothesis that testimonials would have a positive impact if visitors get to see them at the online decision-making moment—the Zero Moment of Truth.\nThey developed a challenger version that looked like this:\nConclusion\nPlacing the testimonial right above the lead generation form led to 50% increase in conversions on the form. This further translated to a 54% decrease in cost per lead for the institute’s Google AdWords campaigns.\nAs always, making sense of the results is an important learning. Testimonials work as strong social proof for visitors and hence add credibility to a landing page.\nIn this case, there was another factor at work—placement. Social proof acts as a strong influence for your visitors’ Zero Moment of Truth. Placing social proof close to the CTA (in this case, filling and submitting the lead generation form) tends to magnify the impact on conversions.",

The company was looking to A/B test changes to their website in order to increase conversions and selected the VWO platform.\nPlease note: The company has changed its name and website design since the time of publishing this case study.\nGoals\nPayPanther’s main goal for undertaking A/B testing was to increase signups from the website.\nTests run\nPayPanther’s original site was based on the belief that less information was better as it would not distract visitors. So their “Pricing and Signup” page was short and barebones functional. But conversions from their website were lower than what they expected. It was felt that perhaps visitors needed more education about the service, and therefore, adding more content on the page would boost conversions.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nNote: The company has changed its name and website design since the time of publishing the case study.\nA/B tests were the only way to objectively and conclusively determine if more content would indeed give them more conversions. PayPanther developed a variation of the “Pricing and Signup” page that had three more elements on it: FAQs about pricing, testimonials, and another call to action button asking people to sign up.\nThis is what the variation looked like:\nNote: The company has changed its name and website design since the time of publishing the case study.\nThis variation was tested against the control for a month on about 1000 visitors. The goal was to measure signups.\nResult: The variation won, delivering a 372.62% increase in signups over the original page. Thrilled by the results, PayPanther has implemented the longer page as their default “pricing and signup” page. They have planned to perform further tests to identify the optimum headlines and CTA texts.\nConclusion\nSo what did the trick? All three changes played a role. By providing answers to the typical doubts and concerns visitors had, the FAQs section added to PayPanther’s credibility and built trust with prospects. Testimonials by others who have used the service served to provide “social proof”- which, as Robert Cialdini explained, is one of the six principles of persuasion.  \nThe new CTA highlighted that it was a “no risk” trial; this made it more attractive to prospective customers- after all, they could cancel anytime.\nLess is not always more- especially when you have to educate prospects about your offering & build credibility and trust.",

        "raw_contents": "About Us\nBased in Belgium, Us specializes in full-funnel digital marketing, including performance marketing, branding, UX/UI design, content creation, and data analytics.\nRecently, they optimized the website of e5, a Belgium-based eCommerce client, using VWO to enhance conversions.\nWhy VWO\nVWO offers me all the tools as a CRO expert to hypothesize, implement, and analyze AB tests.\nVasco Carpentero\neCommerce consultant\nGoals\nThe goal was to encourage more users to initiate and proceed through the checkout stage from the product pages by clearly confirming that their chosen items had been added to their carts. This approach could also reduce bounce rates from product pages, ensuring a smoother shopping experience.\nObservations\nVasco and his team conducted a thorough quantitative analysis to pinpoint specific struggles on e5’s website by examining data in GA4. They then compared the drop-off rate from product pages to checkout with similar webshops and found it notably high on e5’s site.\nNext, they turned to user behavior analysis and reviewed session recordings. They noticed that customers frequently added items to their carts but left without completing their purchases. Naturally, they wanted to figure out why this was happening.\nHypothesis\nIt was believed that visitors who added items to their carts were not informed correctly because the displayed confirmation box was too small. \nThey hypothesized that implementing a more prominent popup confirmation for the add-to-cart action would improve visibility and encourage checkout.\nTests run\nThe control product page displayed a small confirmation box after users added items to their carts. \nIn contrast, the variation was designed to show a pop-up confirmation when users added items to their carts. The two were pitted against one another in an A/B test, leveraging VWO.\nThe test ran for 14 days, and the results were promising. \nHere is how the control and variation looked:\nUs (e5) Control Variation\nTest results\nAdding the pop-up increased the number of users proceeding to the checkout process by 22.31%. The conversion rate from the first checkout page to the next improved by 32.57%, and the completion rate for the payment step increased by 19.39%. \nAdditionally, the expected value per visitor rose from $1.91 to $2.32, reflecting an improvement of $0.41.\nFurther tests and learnings\nThe team also created additional tests, including one where a mini-cart replaced the pop-up. The mini-cart test showed decent results, with a significant increase in conversion rates. \nHowever, it also led to a decrease in the average order value, as users tended to remove more items from their mini-carts.\nMoreover, the team tested the popup separately on mobile and desktop devices. On mobile, the main button on the popup that led directly to checkout performed the best. In contrast, on desktop, users converted more effectively when the main button directed them to their cart.\nMini-cart show:\nConclusion\nIf used correctly, pop-ups can effectively encourage users to take desired actions. For e5, adding a pop-up on the website motivated users to advance to the checkout stage from product pages, helping the business achieve its goal.\nTherefore, instead of simply adhering to widely circulated best practices, it’s crucial to test elements within the specific context of your website. This allows you to evaluate their impact on your audience’s behavior and essential business metrics.\nUs iterated further by testing a mini-cart against the pop-up, but when they noticed it impacted e5’s AOV, they decided to stick with the latter. This just goes to show that what we think works might not be what our users actually experience. That’s why testing is so important!\nYou can easily run tests on a variety of widgets from VWO’s extensive library.

They have extensive experience in engaging their clients in some of the most creative ways and creating memorable online experiences.\nInteractivity Digital’s clients have been using VWO Engage’s push notification tool to increase their webinar attendance and to guide registrants to perform other webinar-related actions.\nGoals\nInteractivity Digital’s primary objective was to increase webinar attendance, share actionables with webinar registrants, and create a database of prospects to follow-up with.\nObservations\nMelanie McMurrain is the VP of Client Strategy at Interactivity Digital. She and her team keep a constant eye on digital trends. They knew that email open rates have been lowering over the past few years. Hence, they keep looking out for new and innovative technologies to help their partner brands connect with their subscribers in a better manner and increase brand visibility.\nTests run\nMelanie was impressed to see that push notifications could be generated at a specific time or over a period of time, and that they had the ability to reach more prospects, without having to rely on email communications. She was excited at the opportunity to send personalized messages based on a users’ behavioral actions.\nUsing VWO Engage, they saw their webinar attendance increase between 4% to 12%. Their push notification subscriber count also shot up and is currently at 1165 subscribers. Apart from that, they continue receiving an average click rate of 10%, with their best click rate at an astounding 36%!\n“Sending webinar-specific marketing push notifications worked particularly well for us since the subscribers knew what to expect. There were lesser instances of complaints or even unsubscribes,” said Melanie\nOnce the webinar is over, they also use VWO Engage to follow-up with their prospects by sharing links to replay webinars and share the scarcity of their offers. The lists that they are able to create with VWO Engage’s help is also serving an additional purpose – creating a database of hot prospects to follow-up with and invite for future training events.\nConclusion\nCurrently, the team at Interactivity Digital has set the opt-in requests to appear on webinar Thank You pages so that it enables people to request for webinar specific reminders as a push notification on their desktop or mobile device.\nVWO Engage’s Segment Creator has been the marketing agency’s favourite feature so far, with its ability to create custom audience segments for better personalization.\nThey also found value in leveraging push notifications 2 hours before a webinar is scheduled to happen and then, again at 15 minutes before the event. As of now, the team uses push notifications as a standalone medium, but they’d love to try collaborating it with other mediums, such as email and social media.",

        "raw_contents": "About WorkZone\nWorkZone is a web-based project management and documentation collaboration tool.\nThe company uses VWO for their testing needs.\nGoals\nThe goal of this campaign was to increase the number of demo requests by reducing distracting elements on the form page.\nTests run\nLike most SaaS companies, WorkZone’s lead generation page offered demos to help convince people to buy their tool. Prospects submitted a short form to request a demo. The page also had customer reviews by authority figures and an arrow pointing to the form acting as a direction cue.\nThis is what the original page looked like:\nSteven Macdonald of WorkZone thought the colored logos used in the customer testimonials overshadowed the form and distracted visitors. He wanted to test the hypothesis that testimonials with customer logos in black and white would help increase the number of demo requests.\nTo test his hypothesis, Steven used VWO, an a/b testing software, to create and then run a quick A/B test. He created a variation with black and white logos and tested it against the original. The test was run only on new visitors coming to the website – this was possible thanks to the behavioral targeting feature of VWO. The goal was to track the number of form submissions.\nHere’s how the variation looked:\nThe variation was pitted against the original (control) in an A/B test that ran for a duration of 22 days.\nConclusion\nThe variation outperformed the control with a 34% increase in form submissions and a statistical significance of 99%. Not surprisingly, Steven decided to implement the change to the WorkZone website.\nIt is fascinating to try and understand what caused buyer behaviour to change. The key, in our view, is to understand behavioural nuances and ensure that the website reflects them effectively. For instance, that the use of social proof is extremely powerful is already known. But not everyone knows how to apply the concept effectively in harmony with web design principles.\nHere’s why the variation beat the control:\n1) The coloured logos were overshadowing the form.\nThe demo request page has a lot of white space and mostly subdued background colors. Eye-tracking studies have proved that pictures get immediate attention. Per visual hierarchy also, the colors of the logos were in contrast with the rest of the page. The coloured logos thus clearly stood out, – but overshadowed the form, which was the website element WorkZone needed visitors to focus on. By using black-and-white customer logos, WorkZone ensured that while they served to trigger recognition and provide credibility for the tool/service, they did not subvert the web form- the hero of the page.\n2) The colored logos looked like clickable entities.\nClickmap and heatmap reports generated by VWO clearly showed that there were mouse movement and clicks on the testimonial bar. This reinforced the view that colored logos distracted visitors. Besides, this design flouted the rule of one page, one purpose.\n  Gain important insights into visitor behavior, formulate effective hypotheses, and run A/B tests to optimize your lead generating landing pages.

        "raw_contents": "About 160 Driving Academy\nIllinois-based 160 Driving Academy offers truck-driving classes and even guarantees a job on graduation. To contact the academy, visitors primarily used the contact form on the home page or called the prominently displayed phone number.\nTo improve the conversion rate on its truck-driving classes page, the academy reached out to Spectrum Inc, a lead-generation software and internet marketing company that is a certified VWO partner.\nGoals\nOn its home page, the academy had been using the stock image of a man driving a truck. Spectrum Inc decided to test the page with the photograph of a real student instead.\nThe rationale behind the hypothesis was that the image of an actual student would increase trust level and should, therefore, outperform the stock image the academy had been using.\n…in this case we had a branded photo of an actual 160 Driving Academy student standing in front of a truck available, but we originally opted not to use it for the page out of concern that the student’s ‘University of Florida’ sweatshirt would send the wrong message to consumers trying to obtain an Illinois, Missouri, or Iowa license. (These states are about 2,000 kilometers from the University of Florida).\nBrian Mckenzie\nSenior PPC Manager\nTwo conversion goals were targeted by the test:\nThe primary conversion goal: Number of visits to the Thank You page. These are the pages that visitors are taken to after they fill out a conversion form on the main page, such as the Contact Us form.\nThe secondary conversion goal: Number of visits to the Registration page. The academy carries a CTA button on its page that says “Register for Classes.” A conversion would be recorded every time a visitor clicked the button and visited the Registration page.\nTests run\nSpectrum Inc decided to run an A/B test.\nHere are the control and variation used for the test.\nConclusion\nThe test results were impressive. The primary conversion goal, which was the number of visits to the Thank You page, went up by 161%. The 98% confidence level associated with the result meant that the probability of this jump in conversions being random and not because of the variation being more effective was only 2%.\nThe secondary goal, which was the number of visits to the Registrations page saw a 38.4% increase. Here too, the confidence level was an impressive 98%.\nWith VWO as an a/b testing platform, you can easily validate your redesign ideas through A/B testing. Take a free trial to check out for yourself!\nAs always, it is useful to understand the art and science behind the role images play in user experience. Even on websites, an image is worth a thousand words. But not any image–it must be relevant to the target audience and the business, and as far as possible, must be unique.\nHere’s why:\nPicture Superiority Effect\nConcepts learned in the form of images are more easily and frequently recalled than other ideas learned through text. Wikipedia explains that this effect is more pronounced in older people. So if your business targets people older than 25+, images are a great way to pass on brand-related information for better recall.\nImages are processed 60,000 times faster compared to text. Billion Dollar Graphics explains, and I quote, “human brain deciphers image elements simultaneously, while language is decoded in a linear, sequential manner taking more time to process.” This is illustrated in the following image.\nSee how much easier it is to understand from the image than from its textual description that that the reference is to a square? If you are in the mood for some serious reading, I strongly recommend this incredibly insightful post on the power of visual communication.\nThis frequently quoted eye tracking study from NN also confirms that we spend more time on images on a webpage rather than on the text itself.\nA test of an “About Us” page that contained thumbnail portraits of each of the members of the team found this: “Here, the user spent 10% more time viewing the portrait photos than reading the biographies, even though the bios consumed 316% more space. It’s obvious from the gaze plot that the user was in a hurry and just wanted to get a quick overview of the FreshBooks team, and looking at photos is indeed faster than reading full paragraphs.”\nEvidently, people focus more on images on a page than on the text itself. And they retain it longer. The case for images cannot be overemphasized.\nNow that we understand the importance of images in the context of websites, let’s look again at the 160 Driving Academy home page—the images used originally and in the more effective variation.\nThe original page had an image—but yet, conversions were low. This can be attributed to three factors.\nWe love ignoring images that look stock\nStock images were a rage back in the late 90s, when taking a good picture was best left to professionals with complex, expensive cameras. Naturally, online businesses that were just starting out had to resort to relatively inexpensive and definitely good-looking stock photos.\nHere’s the issue: we have been exposed to banner advertisements for so long that our eyes have gotten trained to ignore any web element that evokes the feel of an advertisement. The adage “familiarity breeds contempt” holds true and banner blindness has been confirmed to be a real phenomenon in numerous studies.\nStock images are not unique\nI popped the stock image from the client’s old home page into TinEye, a reverse image search engine; and this is what it threw up.\nThat’s 30 other instances on the webpage where the same stock photo was found.\nJust to bring home the point, here’s what Google Image Search found for me.\n175 results! So much for uniqueness and product differentiation. There are more of that image. How’s that a big deal, you might ask. Where do you suppose the stock image of a man driving a truck would figure on the web?\nHere are a few examples.\nThe same stock image is likely to be found on the websites of other businesses that are are also related to trucks; websites which your potential customer might have visited already. Google took just 0.45 seconds to find 175 places on the web where the image appeared. Human users would take longer, but they’ll get there eventually.\nAnd when a potential customer sees a familiar image on your site, how would they judge your business and its credibility? How would anyone recollect seeing the same image somewhere in a corner of the web? Because we are super smart and can identify images seen for as little as 13 milliseconds. To put that in perspective, the time we take to blink once is about 300–400 milliseconds.\nUsing stock images, in and of itself, is not the real problem. There are ways to use good, relevant stock images without running into the problem of duplicates; like having a Rights Managed Licence. Instead, the real problem is:\nUsing irrelevant stock images\nStop being yourself for a moment; slip into the user’s shoes, and I promise we would see better. You are looking to get a truck licence. Google suggests you check out 160drivingacademy.com. So you do what you always do—you click and reach the site.\nNow, remember, you form the first impression of a website in 50 milliseconds. And you’d typically leave a website in 10–20 seconds unless you find a good reason to linger on. What you are looking for is relevance, a sort of a validation that you are in the right place.\nYou scan the page and see the image of a man in the truck. But what information do you actually glean?\nHow established is the place?\nDoes the academy look credible?\nWhy is there a severely cropped image of a man sitting inside a truck?\nIs he the coach?\nOh wait, no! I’ve seen this image before! The Verdict? I can’t trust these guys. Where’s the back button! And curtains down!\nThe variation with the real photo\nStay in the user’s shoes for a while longer, while we analyze the variation to understand why it converted visitors so much better.\nIt’s all about relevance\nYou know the drill: Google tells you, you listen, you are on the academy’s page; but it has the real image now.\n“How does the place look?” “Don’t really know. But that’s a big truck. Branded and all. Place must be established.”\n“Is it credible?” “Can’t be sure, but it looks real! That guy in the picture looks happy, he must be a student. I might even get to learn on one of those trucks in the picture!”\n“Alright, no harm getting in touch with them. Now, how do I contact them?”\nEnough said.\nWe love images that look real!\nThis study shows that users focus their attention on images that look genuine, the ones with real people and objects. Consequently, we ignore images that seem to only have decorative (read stock-ish) purposes. Real images evoke trust.\nOn a business site, users are not looking for emotional gratification. They are looking for hints, information about what they’d get if they decide to buy your product/service. A website that uses real images screams at its users, “This is exactly what you will get if you choose us! It’s great, and we know it!”\nGet the trust, make the sale. Over the years, we’ve been so indiscriminately exposed to every kind of scam, sham, and spam, that we don’t trust easily. Least of all, on the internet. A website that reveals its offerings, plain, and clear leads us to believe there won’t be any nasty surprises. Hence, we trust.\nClever branding and the hidden call to action\nWhat? Where?\nWithout the variation image, there was exactly one part of the site that called out “160 Driving Academy.” With the variation, there are three such places.\nWe’ve already seen how our eyes are drawn to images much quicker than it is to text. The variation image draws attention to itself, and in the few seconds that a visitors’ eyes stay on it, the mind picks up 2 strong branding signals. The brand name itself, and the color associated with it – yellow – generously splashed across the truck in the image. A deceptively simple way to make sure that even users who bounce off the first time remember the brand.\nI wouldn’t be wrong in asserting that a considerable number of conversions resulted from users who revisited the page.\nNo, that’s not all.\nA call to action – that little big thing.\n“Call Today”\nWhat better place to have it than in the image itself! That too, right next to the contact form. It gives the user direction on what’s to be done if they are interested in taking things ahead, and it creates urgency using the term “Today!”. So there, little relevant things matter.\nRoom for Further Testing\nIf you check the academy’s current page, you’ll see that the “Florida Gators” print has been edited out of the student’s sweatshirt. If you remember, Brian had pointed out how the reference to “Florida” might confuse prospects who are primarily from Illinois. Removing the “confusing” text from the image should improve conversions even better. Brian also pointed out that the average age of a student at the academy is close to 40, while the student in the image is closer to 25. From this context, Brian shares his vision for further testing: “..trying to narrow down whether pictures of actual customers, pictures of actual employees, or pictures of actual products/equipment/objects convert best. Then you can do more incremental tests, like whether a 40-year-old student would convert better than a 25-year-old or whether the student should be holding up his license or just standing in front of the truck.”\nTake a free trial with VWO and take your optimization journey to the next level today!",

They also offer expertise in user behavior analysis, web analytics, and white-label services for agencies.\nWith a strong passion for optimizing websites to turn clicks into customers, Convert Better has partnered with VWO to offer A/B testing solutions to their clients.\nGoals\nConvert Better’s client, High Voltage SEO (HVSEO), a leading Arizona-based SEO agency, faced a tough challenge: low conversion rates despite strong organic and paid traffic. \nTheir goal was to increase appointment bookings with the sales team and convert more visitors into clients.\nTo help achieve this goal, Convert Better conducted an audit of the agency’s existing conversion funnel and used VWO to implement A/B testing.\nVWO is indispensable to our CRO agency and allows us to offer flexible and customizable A/B testing solutions for our clients. The visual editor is a breeze to work with, allowing us to implement test ideas quickly, and they have a world-class support team that always answers our questions promptly and professionally.\nTom Qiao\nFounder\nObservations\nConvert Better conducted a thorough CRO audit of HVSEO’s website, analyzing visitor behavior to map the customer journey. \nThey discovered a critical issue – users were frequently dropping off the booking page. \nThis was especially surprising, given their high engagement (long dwell times, frequent clicks, and deep scrolling) on key pages like blogs, services, and the homepage.\nHypothesis\nAs per the agency’s analysis, the original booking page was not delivering the experience that users were expecting. It was not doing enough to build brand credibility among visitors and lacked clarity and persuasiveness, thereby resulting in higher bounce rates and low conversion rates. \nThus they hypothesized that redesigning the complete booking page with new copy, prominent placement of the calendar, and social proof would improve appointment bookings with the sales team. \nThe team decided to test this hypothesis via a split URL test. They also ran another A/B test specifically aimed at lead generation. \nWhat is a Split URL test?\nA Split URL test is a method used to compare two entirely different web pages hosted on separate URLs.

        "raw_contents": "About WMG\nVWO spoke to Brandon Gentry, Director of User Experience at Warner Music Group (WMG), and his team, which is responsible for managing websites of the artists that WMG represents. Over the course of 18 months, the UX team at WMG developed a robust framework for deploying websites that are fine-tuned for conversions and user acquisition.\nThe UX team at WMG ensured that the website optimization process delivers maximum results without any compromise to the websites’ user experience. Along with optimization, it was also important that the websites adhered to the artist’s essence. This success story highlights the conversion optimization challenges faced by the UX team at WMG, and how it has overcome them.\nIn my role at Warner Music Group, I aim to promote a culture of data-driven creative design. We design, build and maintain hundreds of artists’ websites. VWO’s suite of tools help me quickly and easily find conversion optimization wins that I can standardize across our whole enterprise. I don’t like to use the phrase “best practice” unless I can prove it, and my proof is in the data provided by VWO.\nBrandon Gentry\nDirector, User Experience\nObservations\nBefore using VWO, WMG’s UX team worked with a third-party website optimization agency. The third-party partner provided them invaluable data and validated conversion optimization as a strategy to improve user experience and acquisition. However, Brandon realized that their efforts had a better scope if the whole process was carried out in-house with minimal assistance. These were due to the following reasons:\nApproval-dependent process: The third-party partnership led to a slow turnover of results. WMG’s UX team was responsible to provide approvals on development assets, testing hypothesis, and design assets, which made the process slow.\nBudget constraints: Due to the nature of the partnership and the budget allocation, the number of tests carried per year were limited.\nSlow testing speed: Web testing required time. Getting label approval and webmaster approval made the entire process slow. Over the course of a year, WMG could only complete 10 tests.\nWMG’s Conversion Optimization Goals\nIn April 2016, WMG built a dedicated in-house testing team and signed up with VWO to ramp up its conversion efforts. The complete process was streamlined by stitching together the design, user experience, and production teams in a close environment.\nPreviously, WMG’s UX team was able to run 10 tests over the course of a year with its agency partner. Now, they were looking to improve these numbers by at least 2X with overall improvement in the conversion rates as well.\nThe second goal for the team was to measure the scope of a given test in more than one experiment. With an in-house testing team, corroboration of test results became an important goal.\nTests run: Quickly Deploying Learnings Across Websites\nWMG was able to triple the number of web tests ran over a year, taking it from 10 to 38 experiments. The tests also resulted in an average improvement of 5% in conversion rates across 15+ websites.\nMoreover, insights from the successful test results allowed WMG’s UX team to quickly deploy the learnings on their other websites. Here are the key scenarios where WMG had the maximum impact on its conversion rates using VWO:\nHeatmaps and Visitor Recordings Improved Website Conversions by 2.7X\nThe Heatmaps and Session Recordings capabilities provided WMG with an understanding about the visitors’ intent and behavior. With the help of the VWO, WMG optimized 11 websites for a variety of artists. This effort furnished conversion rates 2.7X better than industry standards, based on the data available with them.\nLeverage VWO Insights to identify the elements of your website that catch visitors’ attention and the areas of friction. Start your free trial today!\nSplash Pages Saw an Average Improvement of 4% in Conversions\nSplash Pages are an important source of revenue for both WMG and its associated artists, as these are the pages visitors see first, before being given the option to continue to the homepage. While analyzing splash pages for various artists, the UX team noticed that conversion rates were lower than the industry average. As a countermeasure, Brandon decided to experiment by redesigning the Splash Pages.\nThe redesigned Splash Pages ran 3 A/B tests before going live. Each test result showed an improvement in the conversion rate.\nContextual CTAs Improved Conversions by 18%\nAnother valuable discovery Brandon and his team were able to make using VWO’s Visitor Behavior Analytics was the importance of contextual information accompanying the CTA. By running A/B test based on this insight, they were able to improve conversions.\nBy A/B testing the CTAs based on the contextual information, the team was able to develop a standard series of tests. After replacing the generic messages accompanying the CTA with contextual messages, the conversion rate improved from 14.0% to 18.6%.\nBrandon and his team also experimented with placement of signup forms on their website. The variation saw an improvement of 12% over the control version. The control had a conversion rate of 6.2% compared to 18.4% of the variation.\nConclusion\nWMG is an example of a thriving experimentation-based organization, where every effort toward improving user experience and conversion is derived from a systematic and planned approach.\nWith the sheer number of tests that resulted in positive results for WMG, Brandon and his team were able to develop a guideline to web testing for higher conversion and improved user experience. This was made possible by combining all the observation and hypothesis stored in VWO.\nVWO lets you easily discover insights, build an experimentation roadmap, test ideas and, engage visitors, all within a single platform.

        "raw_contents": "About Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) is one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.\nGoals: Increase Social Sharing of News Published on AMD.com through a ShareThis Icon/Link\nAMD regularly pushes news and other updates around its offerings through AMD.com. They wanted visitors to share such content on various social media to enhance reach.\nTo make sharing easier, AMD had embedded a ShareThis link/icon that is embedded into the pages of the site. On the basis of site metrics and how information was being shared with different social platforms, AMD’s Online Marketing team believed that more could be done. It selected VWO to assist in improving the number of shares.\nAMD’s Online Marketing team wondered if the appearance of the ShareThis icon/link and existing placement was optimal for users, as it was located in the footer of all AMD.com pages. They felt that making the ShareThis icon/link more visible would help make it more widely used.\nAMD’s Online Marketing team decided to use A/B testing to understand user behaviour and interactions with these icons and thus determine the best possible combination of position and appearance of the icons.\nThe testing was implemented and controlled by VWO.\nTests run: A/B Testing Helped Determine Icon Appearance and Optimal Placement\nWorking with VWO tools, the AMD Online Marketing team created and tested 6 variations (including the control version) with different icons and placement. The combinations tested various positions (left, right, bottom) and appearances (icon/link, large chicklets, small chicklets) on one of the more prominently visited and shared sections of the website, Support & Drivers (http://support.amd.com).\nAll 6x variations were deployed on the entire support.amd.com subdomain and ran for 5 days. The test was served to visitors for the first two days, then increased to 35% for the next two days, and then increased to 100% on the last day. The last day also coincided with the launch of a new software driver which typically generates more traffic.\nAfter visitors saw a particular variation, they continued to see the same variation to ensure a consistent user experience. Based on the testing, the AMD Online Marketing team recommended using the left-position chicklet version with dynamic adjustment based on the browser window size.\nConclusion: 3600% Increase in Social Sharing with No Adverse Impact on Overall Engagement\nThe test findings proved to be statistically significant, demonstrating up to a 36x increase in social sharing on the tested site, compared to the original site configuration. The A/B tests also helped the team objectively conclude that the bottom chicklet and link variations were less productive. More important, the tests helped establish that the variations did NOT impact the overall engagement on the pages (average engagement conversion was over 23%).\nThe final result of the testing was in line with expectations, but the wide range of results from variation testing was unexpected. This provided strong support for the continued use of A/B testing for future optimization as well. VWO makes A/B testing easy. Take a free trial to explore the features in detail and decide for yourself.\nAMD’s Online Marketing team had this to say about VWO:\n“VWO has proven to be a great asset to the AMD Online Marketing team by providing a scalable and user-friendly solution that helps to clearly demonstrate user interaction and behavior. The ability to run optimization tests on a regular basis with minimal effort is critical to AMD’s global online presence and in providing an optimal user experience for AMD.com visitors”.",

Uptowork targets all types of job aspirants, especially especially those, who struggle with building their resume in traditional text editors. You can always refer to their blog for some quick tips for your resume. Most of the traffic coming to Uptowork website is organic and through AdWords.\nThe Uptowork team tried making a couple of changes on the website and closely analyzed the GA data to see if it worked. However, GA and other tools were not capable enough to give them all the answers.\nThe Uptowork team understood that there was a huge gap between what the brand wanted to convey and what the visitors perceived. They understood that the one thing lacking was visitor trust on the website.\nWith the objective of filling this trust gap and reducing the cart abandonment rate, the team began its research. While doing the research, it came across this article on the VWO blog, which includes actionable tips to build trust again, for an eCommerce website.\nGoals\nThe key idea was to convey a sense of security to its visitors by completely redesigning the cart page and adding a McAfee trust badge on their cart page.\nTests run\nPer their research, they came up with the hypothesis that adding a McAfee badge will help gain visitor’s trust. They hoped that adding a McAfee badge will ensure a secure payment gateway for visitors and uplift the brand image, further leading to reduction in the cart abandonment rate and increase in the conversion rate.\n\n“We added a McAfee badge to our cart with the assumption that it will reduce the percentage of people leaving the cart. And it did.”\nAlmost a month-long test was ran for their entire user base with the help of VWO’s A/B testing capability.\nThis is how the control looked:\nThis is how the variation looked. Note the McAfee SECURE trust badge on the left:\nConclusion\nThe results of this test perfectly aligned with its hypothesis. Adding the McAfee seal reduced its abandoned cart rate and increased the conversion rate by 1.27 %.\nWe were almost sure that such a small badge wouldn’t have any impact on our bottom line. If it wasn’t for the test we would just remove it and wonder what happened to our sales. VWO made it really easy to prepare the test and track the results.\nRafal Romanski\nProduct Manager\nWhen a small change inspired from a blogpost showed such impact on the conversion rate, you can just imagine the impact of a planned conversion rate optimization for eCommerce.\nWe use VWO to test any visual or content changes that might impact our bottom line. It turns lengthy discussions about what should we do into easy to setup tests that bring results to the table, not opinions. I think this has been the biggest value we got out of using VWO (along with the hundreds of dollars we managed to save on mistakes we would’ve made without it!).\nRafal Romanski\nProduct Manager",

Founded in the UK, Mobal has continued to grow in size, status and services and today is a world leader with operations in Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific. The primary product they offer is a cell phone number that works across the globe.\nGoals\nAs the primary product that Mobal offers is a cell phone number that works across the globe, the choice of a handset would be a secondary factor in the purchase decision. This is what they thought! This is what led them to think of a change and test it.\nTests run\nTheir goal was to determine whether replacing their current deluxe phone with an Android smartphone or adding an Android smartphone to their current offering would provide an increase in sales over the current 3 phone models they offered. So, they ran an A/B test on their international cell phones landing page, which gets traffic from organic, PPC, and direct sources.\n    Control Page – Budget, Classic, and Deluxe Phones\nThe primary motivation for this A/B test was to see whether there is any demand for smartphones from international travelers and also to assess the impact of offering a smartphone on their other products. As international travelers value service and network coverage, they were unsure which variation would convert the best.\nThey started a test with 3 pages, just changing the phone product section of each. One was the original page (control) that you saw above.\nThe other variation looked like the screenshot below:\n3-option variation (with Android option). 13% increase in sales.\nConclusion\nThe results were surprising with the 4-phone option (see the screenshot below) converting 27.77% better than the control page.\nThey felt that an additional phone option may have had an adverse effect on the overall conversion rate, but the test proved them wrong. It was also interesting to see that replacing their current deluxe phone with an Android handset saw an increase in conversion over the control page of 13.3%. Clearly, Android phones worked like magic and helped them gain a lot more customers!\n4-option variation (with both Android and Deluxe phone options) - 27% increase in sales\nFrom this A/B test, they concluded that offering 4-phone option meant a significant increase in the number of phone sales we had and that there was a demand in the market for smartphones.\nSince they used VWO for their split URL test, they gave us a testimonial:\n“VWO allowed us to simply and efficiently conduct a split URL test for our 3 options. The easy to use dashboard system meant that we could identify which product selection offered us the biggest increase in sales.”\nSo, if you are an eCommerce website, make sure you regularly A/B test your product mix. You never know which new products may increase your overall conversions and sales.",

At the time of this success story, it was just 5 months old.\nThey used VWO to increase click-throughs on their coupons.\nGoals\nTo test whether having a large Secure icon in the sidebar would help with the conversion rate. The ICoupon Blog team thought that the icon would help, because it would push down other (distracting) text in the sidebar.\nTests run\nWhat the ICoupon Blog team tested was whether having a large Secure icon in the sidebar would help with their conversion rate. Based on past industry experience, they thought that the icon would help because it would push down other (distracting) text in the sidebar.\nHere are the variations they tested:\nVersion A - With Security Badge in the Sidebar\nVersion B - Without Security Badge in the Sidebar\nConclusion\nThey also had some user testing done, and everyone seemed to notice the Secure button a lot. It was one of the most prominent parts of the page. So they thought removing it helped focus the user on what they wanted them to push.\nThey found that the variation without the secure icon had over 400% improvement on conversions as compared to having the image. [Note: The results are statistically significant.]\nStrangely, removing the icon dropped site engagement by about 17%. However, with their business model, a “bounce” is actually a good thing, so site engagement isn’t as large of a factor. In a nutshell, in this particular case, it looks like the Security badge distracted the visitors from the main focus of the page.\nLessons, as summed up by Bradley Spencer from ICoupon:\nMake each page designed to get the user to do one thing, and try to focus all of their attention on that one thing.\nHe also added a word about VWO, which was used for the test:\nVWO was invaluable. We would have kept wasting user’s attention with that icon without VWO.",

The secondary goal was to improve user engagement.\nObservations\nThe agency collected qualitative visitor data using heatmaps, scrollmaps, and clickmaps to understand how visitors interacted with different product categories and promo banners and see where they were dropping off. Also, they looked into the quantitative data from sources such as Google Analytics, which led to the following observations:\nThe conversion rate for mobile visitors was significantly low; compared to the website’s average.\nThe users navigated to the product categories only from the menu. \n30% of the visitors saw all the selected products on the home page, and 2-4% of the visitors interacted with the call-to-action (CTA) buttons.\nHypothesis\nBased on the observation, the team formed a hypothesis that reducing the up and down scroll would help users find their preferred product as it would limit back and forth and thereby improve the conversion rate of the form.\n  Tests run\nThe hypothesis led to conducting an A/B test with the variation having a redesigned landing page. The new design had multi-level filtering so that the users could dynamically find the preferred product. A long list of products was replaced with carousels. \nThe team ran the A/B test for 14 days on over 5000 visitors, splitting the traffic equally between the control and the variation. The test concluded with the variation outperforming the control.\nThe multi-level filtering add-on and carousel increased the form conversion rate by 20.45% on mobile and 8.50% on desktop. \nAlso, user engagement increased by 70.92%.\nConclusion\nForestView combined qualitative and quantitative analysis with VWO Insights and Google Analytics to comprehend the current user experience. It enabled them to generate hypotheses and perform A/B tests using VWO Testing for their clients.

        "raw_contents": "About ArchiveSocial\nHeadquartered in North Carolina, USA, ArchiveSocial is a SaaS-based social media archiving solution. ArchiveSocial helps organizations fulfill their legal requirements and avoid lawsuits on social media. \nConsistently working on safeguarding context for several brands across networks including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, ArchiveSocial took VWO’s help in safeguarding their own website visitor context.\nWe got in touch with Phillip Roberts, the Leading Web Developer at ArchiveSocial, to have an in-depth look at how VWO has helped the company.\nGoals\nFor ArchiveSocial, the two most important KPIs are an uptick in leads and an increase in conversions, both via their Homepage and ‘Request demo’ page.\nTherefore, they studied their existing pages with an aim to improve on these two metrics by creating hypotheses that could be tested using VWO. VWO Services worked in tandem with Phillip’s team to achieve the following specific objectives:\nIncrease in conversions from the Homepage banner form.\nAccelerate pricing page conversion rate for lead generation.\nImprove user engagement on the site.\nObservations\nAfter a thorough examination of ArchiveSocial’s website, VWO Services, made a few observations:\nWhen a user lands on the Homepage, they are shown the email form field at the very bottom of the Homepage banner, without any differentiation from the remaining page.\nAs the pricing page plays an important role in the final conversion, the team emphasized the need to improve this funnel from pricing to the final conversion page.\nThere was hardly any traffic for the brand’s gated content on the ‘Resource’ page. The challenge was to get more traffic to the resources page and improve engagement on the page.\nTests run\nEach of the above observations was tackled through three different tests, each with a different objective.\nTest 1:\nTo make the primary CTA more legible, a variation of the same was created with differentiating colors. The CTA was also moved to a more prominent position – i.e. first fold, on the right.\nResult: The campaign ran for 27 days for all incoming traffic. Traffic was split equally between the control and the variation. The variation saw an improvement in terms of clicks on the form field by a mighty 101.68%. Using VWO scrollmaps it was found that users were scrolling further beyond the first fold on the variation. The variation is now live for all users.\n  Test 2:\nAfter collating data, a complete design overhaul for the Pricing page was constructed and run as an A/B test. \nThis test’s objective was to improve clicks on the CTAs across plans listed on the Pricing page and move users to the Thank you page, closing the conversion loop.\nThe focus was on highlighting the primary CTA button on the page and explaining to users which plan is worth their money by keeping the options extremely simple. At the same time, the design of the Pricing page leveraged ‘anchoring’ (cognitive bias) by highlighting the most popular (mid-priced) plan on the page design to draw customers’ eyes to it immediately.\n  Result: The campaign ran for seven weeks, with traffic equally split between the control and variation (all incoming traffic participating in the test).  The variation won with the visits to the ‘Thank you’ page going up by 64.76%. The variation is now live for all the users.\n  With VWO Services, we have executed and implemented numerous A/B tests that have helped improve overall CRO architecture across our website.\nPhillip Roberts\nWeb Developer\nTest 3:\nThe hypothesis for this test was that making the Resources section more discoverable by adding the ‘Resources’ category in the top navigation would increase engagement. \nA variation was created where the “Resources” category was added in the top navigation bar so as to make the user-flow to this section more intuitive.\nResult: This campaign ran for 10 days, with all incoming traffic equally split between control and variation. 73.30% traffic uplift was seen on the resource page via variation, and the variation is now live for all the users.\nConclusion\nThe winning variations have made the website far more intuitive and user-focused. The ArchiveSocial team is also more confident about the website’s performance since the changes have been made through a proper loop of insights generation and testing.\nTesting gives more confidence about the changes on the website, to see the real-time performance of the tests.

        "raw_contents": "About Body Ecology\nBodyEcology is an eCommerce store for health products that support the company’s unique “back-to-basics” Body Ecology Diet.\nTo improve website conversion, the company hired digital agency Frictionless Commerce, which uses VWO for its optimization work.\nGoals: Increase Revenue\nBodyEcology’s product range is quite complicated, comprising categories such as Fermented Foods, Probiotic Culture Starters, Body Ecology Core Programs, and others.\n\nAs shown in the image below, the drop-down menu on the original page displayed only the product categories and specific product names.\nFrictionless Commerce realized that this design impeded conversions because the drop-down only contained links. Visitors to the site would find it difficult to identify specific products of interest especially if they had no idea about what these products are about.\nTests run: Make It Easier for Visitors to Find What They Need\nThe test hypothesis was that reducing friction at the first step of selection by replacing the drop-down in the control with the complete product category page (which provided a brief introduction for every product category) will increase the revenue by encouraging more interested visitors to buy.\nThey created a variation in which clicking the Products option on the top navigation bar on the home page would take visitors to the page below:\nFrom the usability perspective, this definitely made a lot of sense, although other basic design updates also needed to be addressed. The variation was A/B tested against the original by using the VWO platform.\nThe image below shows the 2 versions (control and variation) tested:\nThe test ran for 2 weeks.\nConclusion: 56.43% Increase in Revenue per Visitor\nThe variation beat the control by generating 56.43% higher revenue per visitor. The statistical significance of the results was 96%. Over the 2 weeks that the test ran, Body Ecology generated an incremental revenue of $8,880—a projected annual increase of $230,880, assuming the same run rate.\nAs can be seen from the results in our tool, the average revenue per conversion during the test period increased to $143.61 from the earlier figure of $100.33.\nThe use of drop-downs is a well-established practice, so changing a design element like that  very counter-intuitive. The takeaway is not to blindly do away with drop-downs but to test a good hypothesis that reflects the underlying business and its customers and how the drop-down fits into the conversion cycle.\nMega drop-downs have proven to work well in usability tests. But like any conversion tactic, there’s no absolute; it’s all about coming up with good hypotheses and testing them robustly with the relevant set of visitors before implementing any changes.\nAnother important (but often ignored) takeaway from this test is the importance of making clear offers to improve conversions. It’s not the visitors’ job to find out all that they need to make the purchase- it is the website owner’s responsibility to provide a design that intuitively guides visitors, eases their pain points, provided answers to their questions and thus nudge them along the journey to make the purchase.\nWhile the winning variation was great for new visitors (who are probably in “research mode”), it is taxing for repeat customers. For the latter segment, the addition of the new page meant an additional step in the purchase process.\nAware of this miss and its possible impact on sustaining conversion, Frictionless Commerce is looking at additional follow-up tests that will allow Body Ecology address the needs of both fresh and repeat visitors.",

Their easy-to-understand self-help programs are also open to the public.\nThe company uses VWO to test optimization opportunities.\nGoals: Increasing Sign-Ups for Free Videos\nThe company wanted to improve responses to an upcoming product launch. To increase awareness about the company and its expertise and to expand reach, they decided to offer their pack of 3 trauma treatment videos free to visitors who entered their first name and email address on the website.\nThis is how their original page that was used to collect names and email addresses looked:\nIt was essential that visitors were convinced enough to sign up for the free video pack and share their first name and email address. Harvesting these email addresses was important for the company, which planned to use this list to market the newly-launched product.\nTests run: Testing a New Page design For Effective Lead Generation\nThe page capturing first name/email address was crucial to motivate visitors to sign up for the free videos. As such, this was an easy choice for the test. With the goal of increasing sign-ups for the 3 trauma treatment videos,\nUncommon Knowledge decided to implement a new landing page that was more in tune with recent design trends.\nThis is how the variation looked:\nThe new design gave up the traditional magazine layout. It was simple, and explicitly provided visitors with the much-needed assurance that their privacy would be respected and they could opt-out of their newsletter any time.\nConclusion: Original Page Delivered 19.55% More Leads than the New Page\nThe redesigned landing page did not achieve the expected results. In fact, the original, old landing page beat the fancy new one by 19.55% with 99.99% statistical significance.\nAs the team from Uncommon Knowledge said, “This is a highly significant business result.”\nHere is the comparison page showing the original and variation pages:\nAlthough the new design did not deliver the expected results, the results of the A/B test were insightful.\nThis A/B test on their WordPress website showed that understanding one’s target audience can have a huge impact on the conversion rates. The test specifically reinforced the message that following trends blindly may not always be the best choice. While it is easy to follow the herd to follow “modern design styles,” these may not work for all.\nEvery website must be designed and implemented in a way that makes it relevant to its target audience. The demographic profile of visitors to Uncommon Knowledge is shown below:\nAs can be seen from the above (and corroborated by age-range on the company’s Facebook page), a majority of visitors to the Uncommon Knowledge website are aged 45 years or more. As such, it would not be unreasonable to assume that this set of people were generally “low-tech” and would not be affected by the latest design trends.\nThe original page design gave these visitors a good idea about each of the 3 videos in the pack. This piqued their interest a little more than the message in the variation that just told them that it’s a three-pack video set on trauma management.\nAlso, Mark Tyrrell, Cofounder of Uncommon Knowledge and the author of its blogs, is quite well-known among the audience. His photograph (in the original version) added credibility to the overall offer.",

        "raw_contents": "About Open Mile\nOpen Mile (now acquired by Echo Global Logistics) was a startup that used technology and process automation to provide superior broking services around trucking services. Using OpenMile.com, its web platform as well as mobile technology, the company allowed customers to find the best quotes offered by qualified carriers. This created a win-win for both providers and consumers of truck-based freight services.\nThe company used VWO to test optimization possibilities on its website.\nGoals: Increase Leads Generated by the Home Page\nThe home page received a good number of visitors. But only about 4% of visitors to its primary lead generation page (which displayed freight rates) converted to leads. This was a relatively small proportion and the company wanted to increase this percentage.\nTests run: Redesign Lead Generation Page to Enhance Effectiveness\nThis is what the lead generation page originally looked like:\nThe company felt that the existing page masthead was too cluttered and hence distracted visitors. It hypothesized that by improving legibility of the masthead copy and allowing the masthead to occupy a large part of the page, the lead conversion rate from the page would increase.\nThis was the variation page created: \nThe variation page was A/B tested against the original by using VWO.\nConclusion: 232% Increase in the Leads Generated\nThe variation beat the original in the test. Lead generation increased from 3.95% to 13.11%—a whopping 232% jump. The test results had near-perfect statistical confidence of 99.99%.\nHere’s an image that compares the original and variation and highlights what changes were made:\nThe higher conversion rate recorded in the test was clearly the net result of the many changes made by the team. It is instructive to analyze what changes may have contributed to the boost in conversion rates and why.\nStronger Value Proposition\nThe headline on the control page was weak. Even visitors who wanted what the page was offering (such as getting a quote), were not able to figure out what was being offered. As a result,  most of them just passed up on the option.\nThe headline on the variation page did a better job of conveying what data visitors could get, and that it was free and fast.\nDistractions Removed\nThe original page had too many distractions surrounding the primary CTA that would generate leads. From headlines that didn’t communicate the desired call to action to the social media buttons, the distractions were ruining the page’s ability to generate leads.\nThe variation made it clear to the visitors what value they would get and what action they needed to take. The social media buttons were removed, and the Talk to Us button was no longer near the main CTA button.\nMasthead Changed\nThe original masthead was designed on the premise that the image of a truck would instantly communicate to visitors what the site offered, and this in turn would improve the lead generation rate of the page.\nThe redesigned masthead was based on the thinking that the image either stole the thunder and thus eclipsed the CTA or that the image of the red truck escaped visitors’ attention because it blended with the orange background. The masthead on the variation page had no image. Also, the red call to action button stood out clearly against the blue background. This made it easier for visitors to see it, read it, and click it.\nChanges Based on Previous Tests\nThe decision makers at Open Mile had previously tested some other minor but important elements on the page. The winning variation reflected the results of those A/B tests as well:\nThe red CTA button color emerged as a clear winner over blue, gray, and green.\nThe CTA button text Get a Quote beat Get Rates and Get a Truckload Quote.\nA/B test your important CTAs easily with VWO.

The requirement and challenge for this particular A/B test was that they had to vary all buttons on the site at once.\nTests run\nA lot of pages (such as the home page) contained multiple instances of the order button, one for each featured product. This seemed complicated, but with VWO, the GSM.nl team designed it in a matter of minutes.\nThey created an alternative CSS stylesheet, and ran the A/B test on different stylesheets. The stylesheet defined how the Buy Now buttons looked like, so if they would do a split test of stylesheet, it would automatically split test ALL the buttons on the website.\nHere are different variations that were tested:\nWith Text Buttons\nWith Green Buttons\nWith Red Buttons\nConclusion\nThe test results showed that the red (well, technically orange) buttons increased overall website engagement by 5% (statistically significant). Engagement is defined as click on any link on the page, so an increase in engagement means a reduction in bounce rate.\nSales were also measured as one of the goals, which showed an increase too, but due to the relatively short test period, were not proved as statistically significant.\nAs a follow-up, of course, this test will be run long enough to determine if the button color has any effect on the actual sales. We are guessing that it would have made a small contribution to increased sales, as more people used the site actively; but considering that a decision to purchase a product involves numerous variables such as product cost, shipping costs, discounts, and others, it is hard to measure if the change in color can be the determining factor.\nThe case suggests that it’s safe to say to that a bright button color works well for catching attention and reducing bounce rate, and might even help actual sales.\nNo matter how strong your gut feelings are, ultimately data tells the truth.\nIn the case of GSM.nl, it proved that VWO could easily test difficult questions, and provide answers in a matter of days.",

They sell one new design by a new artist every day, starting at midnight CST for $10, and it is only available for a period of 24 hours. After that period, the design rests in peace forever in the T-shirt graveyard and a new one takes over its place.\nThey used VWO for the A/B test.\nGoals\nThey had never done A/B testing before but were intrigued by the concept and wanted to give it a shot. The sense of urgency created by the limited availability of the design can be used effectively to drive sales and that’s what RIPT Apparel did in their first A/B test.\nTests run\nThey tested their current buy button against a new buy button to determine which would have the better conversion rate, the conversion rate here being sales of their T-shirts.\nThe following is their control version (or default). Observe that the button isn’t the first thing to catch your attention, as it blends well into the overall color scheme.\nThey saw an opportunity for improvement, so they replaced their existing button with an attention-grabbing button with a different color scheme (green).\nSee version A of the button below:\nControl\nMuch to their surprise, they immediately saw a rise in sales. Ideally, they should have A/B tested the new version against the old, but this was their first time and as you will read further they did a great job overall.\nVariation A\nEncouraged by the results, they went ahead and created another variation of the button. This time they decided to emphasize on the tactic that they should have used all along—emphasizing limited 24-hour availability.\nFind your best-performing CTA button by A/B testing with VWO. Take a free trial today!\nVariation B (6.3% Increase)\nConclusion\nIt has been demonstrated repeatedly that a sense of urgency drives up the conversion rate and this time too it proved to work best.\nThe version (B) of the button shown above increased their site sales by 6.3% (note that only the button was changed—no new offers, no new products, no new policies).\nThis is what RIPT Apparel had to say about this result:\nWe were astonished by this result. We had no idea that changing one button could result in an increase in sales and have that much of an impact. We wish we found this tool much earlier.\nA great thing about tasting success with A/B testing is that it pumps you up to do even more A/B testing. So, RIPT Apparel is all set for their next phase of testing:\nWe learned to test and test often. We think now that this test is over, we are going to try and test a few different color options, maybe even try some wording choices for our buy button.\n\nThis is what RIPT Apparel had to say about VWO:\nThe sales we have seen since changing and experimenting with our buy button have proven VWO invaluable. I had some issues setting it up due to our shopping cart system and the team at VWO walked me through step by step in order to set it up correctly.\nVWO testing gives you powerful options to set up your tests exactly the way you want to so that you can experiment at scale!

        "raw_contents": "About SmileyCookie\nSmiley Cookies was started by Jim Broadhurst in 1986, as part of the family dining chain called Eat’n Park Restaurants, which was in existence since 1949. They allow you to gift customized cookies to anyone for any occasion (weddings, sports events, corporate events, etc.).\nJim led Eat’n Park to become one of the nation’s most popular full-service restaurant chains with more than 75 restaurants throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. As a practice, the restaurant provides a free Smiley Cookie with each child’s meal.\nGoals\nTrinity Insight wanted to test which value proposition works best for SmileyCookie visitors. They wanted to understand which aspect of SmileyCookie’s service is more important for visitors.\nTests run\nSmileyCookie has a large header location, which they use for seasonal or promotional offers. It is at a prominent place and hence catches visitor attentions. As an eCommerce store can position itself in various different ways, Trinity Insight wanted to test which value proposition works best for SmileyCookie visitors.\nIn other words, they wanted to understand which aspect about SmileyCookie’s service is more important for visitors. Following is a screenshot that shows the header where these value propositions were tested:\nTrinity Insight tested the following 5 different value propositions and designed their respective creatives:\nOrder Today -> Ships Next Business Day\nWant to save $5 OFF your next purchase? SIGN UP NOW ->\n$6.99 Ground Shipping For Your Entire Order\nFREE SHIPPING on any order over $40\nCookies Made Fresh & Hand Iced For You!\nThe following screenshot depicts the creatives that were developed:\nConclusion\nWhile the test was running, the overall conversion rate for the site was 8.98% with an average order value of $29.85, yielding a $2.68/per visit value.\nOver this same period of time, the winning creative, Order Today -> Ships Next Business Day, had a 12.61% conversion rate and a $29.95 average order value resulting in a $3.78/per visit value, a 41% increase over the site average. Note that this increase was statistically significant at 95% confidence level.\nKey Learnings\nCookies are perishable items; and when you order cookies as a gift or for a special occasion, you want them sooner than later.\nNext day shipping increased purchases because it tells the visitors that they don’t have to wait for long to get the cookies. There is no uncertainty, and visitors know exactly when they are going to get the cookies.\nAs these cookies are ordered as a gift or for special occasions, customers may not be very price conscious; therefore, value proposition regarding discounts or low shipping rate didn’t work that well.\nOf course, all this is obvious after we have A/B test results. In fact, all the reasons proposed above may not be true. Interpreting A/B test results is always difficult because if you know why a variation works better, you don’t need to do A/B testing in the first place. You can just implement that variation directly without A/B testing.\nNevertheless, interpreting A/B test results is useful to note what may work in the future for other similar websites. So, if you sell similar perishable items online (say cakes, food, ice-cream, and others), emphasizing how fast your shipping is may increase your purchases. Try A/B testing it!",

        "raw_contents": "About Flos USA\nEstablished in 1962 in Merano, Italy, Flos is recognized as a world-leading manufacturer of innovative lighting solutions. It exports to more than 70 countries worldwide and has single-brand stores in Rome, Paris, New York, and Stockholm among other major locations.\nFlos USA is a subsidiary of Flos, which serves as an online store selling lighting solutions to consumers in the US and Canada. We spoke with Harinder Jaura, chief consultant for VWO Services, about how his team followed a structured CRO process to help Flos USA optimize conversion rates on their eCommerce store.\nGoals\nBeing a niche eCommerce website, Flos USA was struggling with the behemoth issue of low checkout conversion rate. In May 2017, Flos USA decided to work with VWO Services since they lacked the necessary resources and expertise to tackle this situation.\nThe team at Flos wanted to optimize their website in a structured, process-oriented manner, without having to invest in building an in-house team – hence they decided to work with experts from the VWO Services team. For VWO Services team, this translated into the challenge of end-to-end optimization of the website conversion funnel for Flos USA.\nGiven we were dealing with a perennial issue of low conversion rates on our eCommerce store, we wanted to bring in someone who has already tackled this successfully. Since we did not have the bandwidth to build a team in-house, we decided to try VWO.\nDaniel Kamen\neCommerce Director\nTests run\nAfter getting on-board, Harinder, our chief consultant for VWO Services, decided to begin his research by analyzing Flos USA’s website analytics data. Harinder also conducted qualitative visitor research using tools such as heatmaps, scrollmaps, session recordings and more to glean deeper, actionable insights. He realized the best course of action would be to optimize for each stage of the journey a typical visitor follows on their website, i.e.\nVisitor | Homepage > Listing Page > Product Page > Cart Page > Checkout | Customer\nWith this approach in mind, Harinder and his team ran a total of 30 campaigns over a period of 17 months, ultimately increasing checkout conversion rates by about 125%. These tests were conducted to validate the hypotheses which the team had generated by digging into quantitative data and qualitative data using VWO.\nHere are a few successful campaigns which they implemented at each stage of the conversion funnel:\nHomepage\nGoal: Visits to Category Page(s)\nHypothesis: Changing the Homepage layout to be more focused on site navigation will improve visibility and make is easy for the user to find the products they need\nWinner: Variation\nConversion Rate Uplift: 6.77%\nControl\nVariation\nProduct Listing Page\nGoal: Visits to Product Page(s)\nHypothesis: Adding a CTA to the listing tiles will increase relevance for the user and lead to more visits to the product page.\nWinner: Variation 1\nUplift: 47% more orders, 86% more revenue\nControl vs Variation(s)\nControl (No CTA)\nVariation 1 (CTA)\nVariation 2 (CTA + Price + Description)\nVariation 3 (CTA + Price)\nProduct Page\nGoal: Add To Cart\nHypothesis: Updating the Choose Finish option to view color swatches will remove confusion among users\nWinner: Variation 2\nConversion Rate Uplift: 19.35%\nControl vs Variation(s)\nControl (No Color Swatches)\nVariation 1 (Visible Color Swatches)\nVariation 2 (Visible Color Swatches + UI Change for Model selection)\nCart Page\nGoal: Add To Cart\nHypothesis: Keeping only essential information and keeping the header with link to cart page will improve clarity for the user\nWinner: Variation\nConversion Rate Uplift: 36.97%\nControl vs Variation\nControl\nVariation\nResult\nIn a span of 18 months, VWO Services has been able to improve Flos USA’s checkout conversion rate by 125%, which has, in turn, resulted in a ROI of 18X for Flos USA.\nSimplify your checkout process through A/B testing with VWO for improved conversions. Start your free trial today!\nConclusion\nWith quick execution and strong hypothesis at its backbone, VWO Services has been successfully able to optimize Flos USA’s conversion funnel, one test at a time. Harinder and his team have plans to scale their success a notch higher. The next steps in their optimization roadmap include personalization on Flos USA’s website and having a long-term calendar for planned campaigns.\nYou can also take a free trial with VWO to understand more about how we can aid you on your optimization journey. \nThe VWO services team has far exceeded my expectations and continues to push the needle. The team is exceptional in their knowledge and works like an extension of our team doing what the job takes without you having to worry about anything. The fact that communication is clear and they in tandem push us to think differently is a big plus. They handle all the implementation which is amazing so we can move fast. I highly recommend VWO services.\nDaniel Kamen\neCommerce Director",

        "raw_contents": "About YNAB\nYou Need A Budget (YNAB) is a user-friendly application for personal finance management. The company teaches people how to become awesome at managing their money by following a 4-Rule methodology. And they sell personal budgeting software that follows this methodology. The software is elegant, simple to use, and does just what you need it do—meaning you don’t bog down in unnecessary features that eventually make you want to quit (and pull your hair out).\nThey used VWO for testing their new design.\nGoals\nThe YNAB team wanted to increase the number of downloads for the 7-day free trial of their personal budgeting application. So the conversion goal tracked was the number of free-trial downloads.\nTests run\nFor their first test, they chose to optimize the product tour page. For software applications, the tour page takes up the job of convincing a casual visitor to try out the application.\nMotivated visitors will anyway download the application, so it is the semi-interested visitors who need to be convinced.\nTo optimize the tour page, YNAB chose to do a simple A/B split URL test with the conversion goal as downloading of the free trial.\nThey designed the variation with the following objectives in mind:\nRequire less clicking by showing that all screenshots as nice, large thumbnails.\nFreshen up the design of the page (having handwriting-type captions).\nStrengthen the call to action with a prominently placed testimonial at the very top.\nAs you will see below, the major change was including many more screenshots and hence not requiring a visitor to click different categories to see what the app can do.\nYou see, semi-interested visitors are more likely to hit the back button than activity hunt for what your app can do. So, including all relevant functionality of the app in the form of screenshots on a single page did the trick of convincing them to download the free trial.\nHere are the screenshots of variations:\nOriginal/Control\nVariation: 85% Increase in Downloads\nConclusion\nThe variation with more screenshots and lesser categories/links increased downloads by 85%. This result was statistically significant at 97% confidence, so YNAB has implemented it permanently for their tour page.\nIn their own words, here is what they concluded from the test:\nWe simplified the page presentation and strengthened the call to action with a very convincing and authoritative quote.\nLike many other customers, they had great praise for VWO:\nVWO was extremely valuable. We’ve been working with Google’s website optimizer for the past three years and we’re never going back. We were constantly having to jimmy-rig the script code, make sure it was not conflicting with Adwords code, or Google Analytics, etc. It was a big enough nightmare that we avoided testing as much as we could – something that cost us real money over that time obviously.\nAre you wondering what is going to be the next page they are going to optimize? The home page, of course! YNAB will optimize their complete funnel, from the home page to the product tour to payment. We wish YNAB best of luck for their future tests.",

        "raw_contents": "About Betfair\nBetfair claims to be the world’s leading online betting exchange platform. Their business model is to allow bettors to set odds among themselves, thereby eliminating the need to have a traditional bookie. The site offers a range of sports betting products, including poker and casino games.\nGoals: Applying Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion to Improve Its Website\nThe Betfair marketing team was inspired by the 6 “keys of persuasion” posited by Robert Cialdini in his book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. The book, believed to be a must-read for marketers, identifies and describes the 6 persuasion principles: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Commitment & Consistency, Liking, Authority, and Social Proof.\nThe Betfair site attracted traffic through various paid channels such as PPC and Affiliates. The need was to increase registrations from their own website (including the mobile version). The company’s Facebook page had a large number of followers, but they were not being harnessed effectively.\nIn terms of Cialdini’s principles, Betfair realized that although it had the “social proof,” it was not utilizing it effectively to persuade prospects. The team wanted to modify its website so that it is could apply Cialdini’s principles of Social Proof, Reciprocity, and Scarcity to influence customers and prospects more effectively.\nTests run: A/B Testing Assisted by VWO Tools Helped Establish Cialdini’s Principles Relevant to Betfair\nUsing VWO’s tools, Betfair decided to A/B test its main landing page. This is what control looked like:\nThe mobile offering on Betfair’s landing page contributed to the business value. But Betfair’s optimization team saw it more as a potential distraction that encouraged channel hopping when their aim was to keep visitors focused on the registration journey. They also had their doubts if the mobile offering had any impact on conversions from this landing page.\nThe team decided to test the hypothesis that replacing the mobile offering with a message that emphasizes one of Cialdini’s persuasion principles would have a positive impact on conversions and increase the click-through rate (CTR) to the registration page.\nIt took only a few clicks for the team to set up the test by using VWO’s WYSIWYG Editor. Three variations were made; in each, the mobile offering was replaced by content designed to reflect one of the three persuasion principles.\nReciprocity\nScarcity\nSocial Proof\nYou can see the comparison image to get an idea of the changes made:\nConclusion: 7% Uplift in CTR to “Start Registration”\nThe test results underscored the validity and power of Cialdini’s principles. The hypothesis proved to be right, as all 3 variations tested positive for both the goals of click-through rate and page engagement. However, only the results of the Social Proof variation were statistically significant. The Social Proof variation stood out as the clear winner of the test with 96% chance to beat the original. The Social Proof variation also outperformed other variations and beat the original with 4.18% for the Page Engagement goal.\nHere’s what Betfair had to say about the results: “Winning experience drove a 7% uplift in CTR to start Registration which at that step of the funnel and with the large numbers we get at that level makes a significant impact.”\nOften, we ignore the value of the 6 principles, even though we see them in action all the time. For example:\nRushing to buy fad products. Remember Furby or Tamagotchi? If everyone is buying something, we think it is worth buying. That’s how social proof works on websites.\nWould we not kill (hopefully, not literally!) to get our hands on one of those limited edition books? That’s the scarcity principle in action.\nAnd of course, you know about the simple “give and take” philosophy. You cannot build relationships without reciprocity. Friendships, business partnerships…all these depend on it. Offer some value to your potential customers, maybe in the form of valuable ebooks, reports, blog posts, or videos, and then expect them to buy from you.\nAll this leads to an important takeaway—make sure that the focus of your landing page is spot on. To get the best results, you must decide one primary goal for your landing page.\nAnything that doesn’t add value to that particular goal should be replaced with a more relevant element that can influence visitors’ decision and push these further into the conversion funnel. It worked for Betfair, and it can for you if done the right way.",

        "raw_contents": "About CZC\nCzc.cz is a leading online retailer dealing in computers, mobile phones, gaming devices, and other electronics in the Czech Republic. CZC is a VWO client and uses the VWO platform and tools for ongoing testing of improvements to its website.\nGoals\nCZC decided to undertake a split URL testing campaign to encourage first-time visitors to buy from its website and to boost their revenue.\nTests run\nBuyers in the Czech Republic are especially price-sensitive. Tomas from CZC felt that revenue could be boosted if CZC could credibly convey that its prices were indeed competitive. To encourage first-time visitors to buy from its website, CZC decided to add ratings from Heureka, one of the Czech Republic’s most popular price comparison sites.\nThis is what control looked like:\nThe Heureka badge test was run on all product pages. The Heureka widget runs a script which shows real-time customer reviews, ratings, and statistics to visitors. CZC’s initial hesitation to share their customer details with a third party (Heureka) prompted them to test the Heureka badge for only 50% of the traffic to its site.\nWhen thinking about testing the Heureka Badge, Tomas also wondered if the placement of the Heureka Badge would make a difference to engagement and conversions. He felt that optimal placement of the badge would give CZC more strategic advantage.\nTomas and his team came up with four variations for a split URL test. More than 90,000 visitors became a part of the test. The primary goal tracked was revenue.\nVariation 1: Heureka badge along with ratings just below the “add to cart” button\nVariation 2: Only the badge just below the “add to cart” button\nVariation 3: Slide-in ratings on the right side\nVariation 4: Slide-in ratings on the left side\nA visitor hovering over the ratings sidebar would see details of ratings and reviews:\nConclusion: 7.5% increase in revenue\nThe results were statistically significant. Variation 4, with slide-in ratings on the left, emerged as the winner. It recorded a 7.5% increase in revenue with a 95% confidence level.\nAnalyzing each of the versions to understand why they did not win is instructive. The insights are helpful in envisioning future optimization possibilities and designing tests in the future.\nVariation 3\nBecause of the F-shaped reading pattern of the web, it is quite likely that the slide-in ratings on the right side were easily missed in visitors’ eye path. Test data supported this, as there was no improvement in conversion rate.\nVariation 2\nThis version had only the Heureka badge and no reviews or ratings. Visitors clicking on the badge would be taken to the Heureka website where the odds of them being distracted by competitors’ reviews and other purchase options goes up. This may have contributed either to lower motivation level in prospects or simply resulted in a bounce.\nVariation 1\nMany people instinctively felt that this version would be the winner. But it wasn’t. Here are two reasons that might explain why this variant did not win.\nCzc.cz recorded the number of times people clicked on the Heureka badge for each variation. A large number of people clicked on the circular badge in both versions 1 and 2, while no one clicked on it in versions 3 and 4, where the badge was displayed within the slide-in ratings. Thus, the badge might have distracted visitors, causing them to click through to the Heureka site (and hence be a bounce for Czc.cz).\nWhile making a purchase, people tend to look at many options within their budget. This means they look at a lot of product pages before the actual purchase. So the ratings and reviews on every product page right next to the “add to cart” button can increase the likelihood of the badge being clicked to verify the claims on it.\nIt is just as important to understand why variation 4 won.\nVariation 4 emerged as a winner as the prominent review bar in yellow on the left-hand side did only the job it was required to- let people know this website can be trusted. The placement of the widget on the left didn’t impede the typical F-shaped reading pattern of the page; yet, it was quite noticeable. Hovering over the review bar displayed several ratings and numbers that gave a big boost to the site’s credibility; it also prevented visitors’ clickthrough to the Heureka site.",

EB causes blistering and severe pain in infants, and without proper treatment, it can lead to life-threatening infections or even death.\nThis organization is committed to a noble cause—providing these vulnerable babies with the right medical care and support to relieve their pain and give them a chance at a happy, pain-free life.\nTo further its mission, No Baby Blisters turned to VWO to optimize its website and improve its conversion rate, ensuring more people can support and donate to their vital cause.\nWhy VWO\nVWO is helping us save more rare disease children by increasing our donation conversion rate.\nDr. Aaron Tabor\nMD, Founder\nObservations\nThe team at No Baby Blisters realized their donation conversion rate was low. \nUpon closer inspection, they found that the landing page was cluttered with too many elements, likely overwhelming visitors and distracting them from donating. \nSince children suffering from this rare disease rely on donations for life-saving treatments and medical supplies, increasing that conversion rate became critical.\nHypothesis\nThe observation led to the hypothesis that simplifying the page by removing website elements such as trust badges and menus would streamline the user experience, keeping donors focused on the most important action: contributing to the cause.\nTests run\nThe team at No Baby Blisters put their hypothesis to the test by running a split URL experiment using VWO Testing. They created one variation of the original landing page (Control) to see if a simpler design could boost donations. \nHere’s a breakdown of the control and variation, including the key changes made:\nControl: The original landing page had a top menu, a trust badge at the bottom, and a layout with baby photos and information on the right, while the donation checkout was on the left. This setup created distractions, making it harder for potential donors to focus on contributing.\nVariation: The top menu was removed and replaced with a prominent “Donate” CTA to declutter the page. The trust badges were eliminated, and the layout was flipped, with the donation checkout on the right and the baby photos and information on the left. A donation progress bar was added at the top to show how much had been contributed, encouraging further donations. At the bottom, a list of other babies who needed donations was included, nudging donors to help more.\nHere is how the control and variation looked:\nThe split URL test ended and Variation emerged as the winner, improving the donation conversion rate by an impressive 47.46%!\nConclusion\nWith VWO’s assistance, No Baby Blisters successfully improved their donation rate, helping vulnerable infants receive the vital medical care they need.\nSometimes, less truly is more, and this proved to be the case for No Baby Blisters. By testing their hypothesis using VWO, they uncovered the hidden potential to convert more prospective donors.\nIf No Baby Blisters’ success story has inspired you and you’re eager to see what VWO can do to elevate your conversions, why not sign up for a 30-day free trial? \nExplore VWO’s extensive experimentation features and witness firsthand how easy it is to conduct tests that align with and drive your business objectives.",

        "raw_contents": "About Penn Foster\nHeadquartered in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Penn Foster is a for-profit online college dedicated to helping students achieve their goals through affordable, accessible, career-focused learning. With the same mission for over 125 years, Penn Foster aims to provide knowledge that builds career growth and confidence in any budget, around any schedule. \nPenn Foster has been using the VWO Experience Optimization Platform for all its UX and conversion optimization needs for the past 2 years. We got in touch with Elizabeth Levitan, Digital Optimization Specialist at Penn Foster, to learn all about their latest winning experiment.\nGoals\nPrevious tests showed that the best way to increase both leads and enrolls was to send paid traffic to a more consolidated page instead of the full site, but it was never implemented on brand traffic before. Therefore, towards this end, the Penn Foster team hypothesized that creating a separate landing page with a high mobile speed score and less information would deliver a more relevant experience to the user. The main objective behind this test was to generate more leads and, in turn, get more enrolls.\nObservations\nPenn Foster’s paid search campaigns weren’t converting at the expected rate based on experience with brand campaigns and industry benchmarks. All of their branded traffic was being sent to their main website. Paid brand campaign traffic being more valuable, lower-funnel traffic, the team at Penn Foster was concerned about sending this traffic to the main site. They hypothesized that exposing potential leads to too much information would overwhelm them, thereby causing them to bounce off without converting to a lead.\nTests run\nWhen looking to optimize, the first thing that Penn Foster looks at is performance. The KPIs considered are – click to lead (CTL), click to enroll (CTE), lead to enroll (LTE), and the lifetime value (LTV) of those enrolled. After identifying pages that need improvement, the team at Penn Foster often use heatmaps and session recordings to identify possible pain points for users and find opportunities for improvement. However, for this test, they solely relied on quantitative data and VWO testing.\nThe Test: The metric tracked for this experiment was click-to-lead, and this is what control looked like:\nApproximately 35,000 visitors became a part of the test that ran for 24 days, with one variation challenging the control. Traffic was equally split between the two experiences and delivered through the VWO Testing capabilities. \nThis is what the variation looked like:\nThe variation won with a staggering 202% jump in conversion rate as compared to the control.

The new landing page (the winning variation) now has two clear CTAs (to become a lead or to enroll), and this direction seemed to help users get the information they were looking for. Click to enrollment also increased – highlighting that the majority of brand traffic was either looking to become a lead, and get more information or to straightaway enroll.\nElizabeth Levitan\nDigital Optimization Specialist\nThe winning variation has been made live across Penn Foster’s brand campaigns that were previously going to their main site’s homepage.\nConclusion\nPenn Foster treats experimentation as an iterative process, and having moved everything over to the new landing page, the team carried out micro testing based on the optimization opportunities that VWO Insights’ heatmaps and session recordings highlighted. The future plan is to run similar tests on the remaining subset of campaigns that are still being sent to the full site. Build a robust CRO roadmap using VWO’s extensive suite of features.

Testing opportunities are endless and it has allowed us to easily identify, set up, and run multiple tests at a time. It’s helpful for us to be able to set multiple goals for our tests so we can easily track leads and enrolls and VWO allows us to do that seamlessly.\nElizabeth Levitan\nDigital Optimization Specialist",
